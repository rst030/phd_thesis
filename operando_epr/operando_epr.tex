\subsection{The Spin Hamiltonian}
\paragraph*{Electron Spin}
In the Poincar√© group of special relativity~\cite{poincare_1905}, when relativistic boosts and rotations are considered, there emerges an additional quantity that is preserved together with the orbital angular momentum, yet it is retained for point objects - spin~\cite{kuprov_2023}. Spin is quantized, it can take values in integer- or half-integer multiples of the Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ up to a certain magnitude $S$. The electron, as a fundamental particle and a fermion, bears a half-integer spin with a magnitude of $S=1/2$. Spin combines with the charge of the electron to endow the electron with a magnetic moment $\vec{\mu_{spin}} = \gamma\vec{S}$, where $\gamma=\frac{g_e\mu_B}{\hbar}\approx 28.025$~GHz/T is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron, $\mu_B=\hbar e/m_e$ is the Bohr magneton and $g_e \approx 2.00231930$ is the electron g factor. The magnetic moment of the electron is quantized~\cite{SternGerlach1922}: the eigenvalues of the spin operator for the electron $\vec{\hat{S}}$ take only two half-integer values $\pm\frac{\hbar}{2}$. 
\par
When an electron is placed in a static magnetic field $\vec{B_0}=B_0 \vec{e_z}$, its magnetic moment precesses about the field direction with the Larmor frequency $\omega_L = \gamma B_0$. The projection of the electron spin on the direction of the magnetic field can take only discrete values between $-S=-1/2$ and $S=1/2$, so that the eigenvalues of the $z$ component of the spin operator are also discrete: 

\begin{equation}
\label{sz_states}
\hat{S}_Z\vert{\uparrow\rangle}=+\frac{\hbar}{2}\vert{\uparrow\rangle}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
\hat{S}_Z\vert{\downarrow\rangle}=-\frac{\hbar}{2}\vert{\downarrow\rangle}
\end{equation*}

The two eigenfunctions of $\hat{S}_Z$ are called the spin-up state $\vert{\uparrow\rangle}$ and the spin-down state $\vert{\downarrow\rangle}$. The two corresponding eigenvalues $\pm\frac{\hbar}{2}$ define the energy difference between the states $\vert{\uparrow\rangle}$ and $\vert{\downarrow\rangle}$, that is known as the Zeeman splitting. Depending on the effects that are relevant for the local environment of the electron, its Hamiltonian contains a number of terms, each corresponding to a certain type of interaction.

\paragraph*{Zeeman Splitting}
The energy of a free electron placed in the external magnetic field $\vec{B_0}$ is the eigenvalue of the spin Zeeman Hamiltonian: $\hat{H}_{EZ} = \frac{\mu_B}{\hbar} g_e\vec{B}_0\cdot\vec{\hat{S}}$. In the laboratory frame of reference $\vec{B_0}\parallel\vec{e_z}$, $\left[\hat{H}_{EZ},\hat{S}_z\right]=0$, so $\hat{H}_{EZ}$ and $\hat{S}_Z$ share the two eigenfunctions $\vert{\uparrow\rangle}$ and $\vert{\downarrow\rangle}$. The Zeeman energies of the electron are $E_{EZ}^{\pm} = \pm \frac{1}{2}\mu_B g B_0$, their difference defines the magnitude of the electron Zeeman splitting at a given magnetic field:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:epr_resonance_condition}
\Delta E_{EZ} = \mu_B g_e B_0
\end{equation}
 

\paragraph*{Nuclear Spin and Nuclear Zeeman Splitting}
A proton has a half-integer spin $S=1/2$ that results in a magnetic moment $\mu_p = \mu_e\frac{m_e}{m_p}$, that is $\frac{m_e}{m_p}\approx1836$ times smaller than the electron's magnetic moment. A neutron bears no charge but also has a half-integer spin $S=1/2$. An atomic nucleus that consists of protons and neutrons has a magnetic moment which is a vector sum of the aligned spins of its protons and neutrons (nucleons). The spin of a nucleus is defined by the arrangement of its nucleons and on the nuclear charge. A nitrogen nucleus has 7 protons and 7 neutrons that total in a nuclear spin $I=1$ which, with the g factor for the nitrogen nucleus $g_N$, results in the nuclear magnetic moment of $\mu_N=\mu_Bg_N\frac{m_e}{m_N}I$ that splits into three Zeeman energy levels corresponding to the three possible projections of the nuclear spin on the magnetic field axis, $m_I=-1,0,+1$, analogously to the electron with $m_S=1/2,-1/2$. The nuclear Zeeman splitting is more than two orders of magnitude weaker than the electron Zeeman splitting because of the difference in the masses of the particles.

\paragraph*{Hyperfine Interaction}
The magnetic moments of an electron and a magnetic nucleus, such as nitrogen, couple in the hyperfine interaction~\cite{Schweiger2001_hfi}: $H_{HF}=\vec{\hat{S}}\textbf{A}\vec{\hat{I}}=H_F+H_{DD}$ with the hyperfine coupling tensor $\textbf{A}$. The isotropic part $H_F=a_{iso}\vec{\hat{S}}\vec{\hat{I}}$, or the Fermi contact interaction, scales with the probability density of the electron at the position of the nucleus $a_{iso}=\frac{2}{3}\frac{\mu_0}{\hbar}g_e\mu_eg_n\mu_n\vert\psi(0)\vert^2$. The anisotropic part $H_{DD}=\vec{\hat{S}}\textbf{T}\vec{\hat{I}}$ with the dipolar coupling tensor $\textbf{T}$ takes into account the anisotropic dipole-dipole coupling between the magnetic moments of the electron and the nucleus.

\paragraph*{Nuclear Quadrupole Moment}
The nitrogen nucleus has a spin greater than 1/2 which alters the charge distribution within the nucleus which gives rise to a non-vanishing nuclear electrical quadrupole moment $Q$. The interaction between the asymmetrically distributed charge and the gradient of the electric field at the nucleus is given by the nuclear quadrupole Hamiltonian $H_{NQ}=\vec{\hat{I}}\textbf{P}\vec{\hat{I}}$ with the nuclear quadrupole tensor $\textbf{P}$ that describes the coupling of the nuclear quadrupole moment to the electric field gradient.

\paragraph*{Exchange Interaction}
In a system of closely placed electrons, such as in a film of densely packed nitroxide radicals, the electron orbitals may overlap significantly and the radicals may exchange electrons. The energy required to exchange the electrons is called the Heisenberg exchange coupling $H_{exch} = \vec{\hat{S_1}}\textbf{J}\vec{\hat{S_2}}$, that becomes considerably large at inter-spin distances below $r<1.5$~nm or with a large spin delocalization~\cite{Schweiger2001_exch}. The positive $\textbf{J}$ corresponds to a weak coupling between $S_1$ and $S_2$ which leads to an antiferromagnetic or antiparallel alignment of spins with a total $S=0$, whereas the negative $\textbf{J}$ causes the strong inter-spin coupling which leads to a ferromagnetic alignment with $S=1$.

\paragraph*{Magnetic Dipole-Dipole Interaction}
The dipole-dipole interaction between the two neighboring electron spins contributes one more term to the spin Hamiltonian: $H_{dd} = \vec{\hat{S_1}}\textbf{D}\vec{\hat{S_2}}$ that depends on the distance between the spins. 

\paragraph*{The Spin Hamiltonian}
For the interactions considered in this thesis, the following Hamiltonian will be applied to describe the interactions of unpaired electron spins with their local environments, ranging by their magnitude:
\begin{equation}
H = H_{EZ} + H_{HF} + H_{J} + H_{NZ} + H_{dd} + H_{NQ} =
\end{equation}

The electron Zeeman term $H_{EZ}$ defines the requirements on the hardware and sets the range of the magnetic fields used in the spectroscopic experiments. The hyperfine interaction term $H_{HF}$ allows for reconstruction of the hyperfine coupling tensor from the recorded spectra which is used as a marker to identify the molecular structure and dynamics of the mobile molecular fragments in an electrochemical cell in Section~\ref{sec:operando_cwepr}. The exchange interaction term $H_{J}$ and the dipole-dipole interaction term $H_{dd}$ will be used to characterize the packing of the molecular fragments in the cathode film. The nuclear quadrupole interaction term will be used to speculate on the unusual peak intensities in the cryogenic pulsed EPR spectra of charged films in Section~\ref{sec:pulsed_epr}.


\subsection{Instrumentation}
\paragraph{cwEPR Hardware}
First observed in 1944~\cite{zavoisky_1945,salikhov_2015}, the phenomenon of electron paramagnetic resonance had become a tool for probing local molecular environments in species that contain unpaired electron spins. A free electron, that does not interact with its environment and has $g=g_e$, experiences a Zeeman splitting of $\Delta E = g \mu_B B_0$, that corresponds to the energy of a photon with a frequency of $\nu=\Delta E / h$. At $B_0\approx0.3$~T, a microwave photon with $\nu\approx9.5$~GHz (IEEE X band, $\nu=8-12$~GHz, $\lambda=2.5-3.8$~cm) can drive the magnetic dipole transition between $\vert{\uparrow\rangle}$ and $\vert{\downarrow\rangle}$ - that is called the spin flip. In a simple cwEPR experiment, the frequency and power of the microwave source is kept constant and the magnetic field is scanned around the values given by the Eq.~\ref{eq:epr_resonance_condition}. and the microwave absorption is observed as a function of the magnetic field. The allowed spin transitions are manifesting themselves as peaks in the microwave absorption coefficient when recorded with respect to the magnetic field. More advanced methods that involve coherent spin dynamics and pulsed microwave fields are discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:pulsed_epr}.

A basic cwEPR spectrometer consists of a magnet, a microwave source, a resonator and a detector. Figure~\ref{fig:cwerp_spectrometer} depicts those elements with more details.

\par
To ensure that only the magnetic component of the microwave photon is interacting with the sample, a standing microwave is formed in a resonating cavity with a resonance frequency close to that of the microwave source. In the center of the cavity, the magnetic component of the microwave is maximized and the electric component is quenched. When the sample is inserted in the center of the cavity, it is mostly the magnetic component of the microwave that is interacting with it. That allows one to drive a magnetic dipole transition without heating up the sample. A sample of finite dimension, especially if it contains metals, changes the distribution of the microwave field inside the cavity, shifts the resonance frequency of the cavity and changes its quality factor $Q$. The frequency of the microwave source is adjusted so that it fits the new eigenmode of the cavity. 




and the external magnetic field is swept. When the resonance condition is met~\ref{eq:RESONANCE_CONDITION}, the spin flip occurs and the photon is being absorbed by the sample. The resonance absorption of microwaves can be detected by a small decrease in the quality factor $Q$ of the resonating cavity, as the magnetic field is being scanned and the microwave frequency is kept constant. The change in the $Q$ factor during the spin flip leads to temporal decoupling of the resonator, that causes reflections of the microwave that would have entered the resonator off resonance. The intensity of the microwaves is measured with a biased semiconductor diode that has a linearly changing conductivity in the range corresponding to  the incident microwave power. A phase sensitive detection with the shallow modulation of $B_0$ increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and yields the derivative of the resonance absorption profile. The typically high $Q\gg1$ factor of the resonating cavity further increases the SNR.


\section{EPR Spectroscopy of a Charging Electrochemical Cell}
There is a number of difficulties when it comes to an EPR experiment on a working electrochemical cell. The cell must contain mobile ions between its electrodes - cations and anions. The ions are normally produced as products of dissociating salts. To overcome the ionic bond in a salt and to break it into the ions, a solvent with large dipole moment is needed. Solvents with large dipole moments, as acetonitrile (CH\textsubscript{3}CN, $\epsilon\approx 37.5$) or water ($\epsilon\approx78.4$), have large dielectric constants which results in a non-resonant absorption of microwaves. A cell containing liquid electrolyte absorbs microwaves and lowers the sensitivity of the EPR experiment. Furthermore, due to a finite dimension of cell, not only the magnetic component of the microwave is interacting with the electrolyte, but also the electric one - this results in heating of the electrolyte in a similar fashion as in a microwave oven. The heating of the electrolyte leads to a faster degradation of the cell and does not allow for long systematic measurements.\\
Another general issue with the operando EPR and EDMR experiments is that the device under testing (DUT) has to have metal electrodes that deliver current to it. Metals, placed in a microwave cavity, change the distribution of the electromagnetic field in it - that weakens the magnetic component at the device and at the same time strengthens the electric component. It is the magnetic dipole transition that is causing the magnetic resonance, so the weakening of the magnetic component by introducing the metal electrodes further decreases the magnetic resonance response. The increased electric component causes heating to temperatures that can be critical for the DUT operation.

There are four characteristic cwEPR signatures of an electrochemical cell containing di-TEMPO-Salen polymer cathode. The well known signature of a freely tumbling TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ exhibits three narrow lines corresponding to the three nuclear sublevels of nitrogen: $m_I=-1,0,+1$.

\subsection{Monitoring of Self Discharge}
Organic Radical Batteries have a tendency to self-discharge, as the organic electrochemically active layer partially dissolves in polar electrolytes. Particularly for the TEMPO containing ORB, the dissolved, mobile TEMPO fragments serve as redox shuttles that carry the charge between the battery electrodes and cause a self discharge. The amount of unoxidized TEMPO$^\bullet$ shuttles can be measured with cwEPR spectroscopy as the mobile fragments have distinct spectra as compared to the fragments tightly packed in the electrode. Further in this subsection operando spectra of a TEMPO containing electrochemical cells are shown. Quantitative analysis of the released fragments during a charge-discharge cycle allows for a description of the self-discharge process in an ORB. The charge state of a battery is monitored with cwEPR and, additionally, with a potentiometric measurement to identify the self-discharge rate and to connect it with the concentration of diffusing redox shuttles.
