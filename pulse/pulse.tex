\section{Coherent Spin Motion under Pulsed Microwave Field}
The motion of the magnetization vector $\vec{M}(t,\vec{r})$ precessing in a static magnetic field $B_0$ is convenient to consider in the rotating frame of reference that has its $\vec{z^{\prime}}$ axis fixed to the magnetization vector ${\vec{z}}~^{\prime}\parallel\vec{M}$ so that the $x^{\prime} y^{\prime}$ plane rotates around $\vec{M}$ at the Larmor frequency $\omega_L=\gamma B_0$ when viewed from the laboratory frame $\vec{x},\vec{y},\vec{z}$, with $\gamma\approx2X$~MHz/T for the gyromagnetic ratio for electrons described in Section~\ref{sec:spin}. In the rotating frame, the macroscopic magnetization stays constant as long as the spin system interacts only with the static field $B_0$. When the spin system is excited with a linearly polarized microwave field $\vec{B_1}(t,\vec{r})\perp\vec{B_0}$, its evolution is described with the set of equations that is known as the Bloch equations (Eq.~\ref{eq:Bloch}). Let the microwave field of frequency $\omega_1$ and amplitude $B_1$ propagate along $\vec{z}$ and be polarized in the $xz$ plane: $\vec{B_1}(t,\vec{r})=B_1\vec{x}\cos\left(\omega_1t\right)$. The total magnetic field $\vec{B}=\vec{B_0}+\vec{B_1}$ causes a time-dependent torque on the $\vec{M}$ which leads to its precession - this time in the rotating frame of reference:

\subsection{Bloch Equations}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bloch}
\frac{dM_x(t)}{dt} = \gamma\left(\vec{M}(t)\times\vec{B}(t)\right)_x - \frac{M_x(t)}{T_2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bloch}
\frac{dM_y(t)}{dt} = \gamma\left(\vec{M}(t)\times\vec{B}(t)\right)_y - \frac{M_y(t)}{T_2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bloch}
\frac{dM_z(t)}{dt} = \gamma\left(\vec{M}(t)\times\vec{B}(t)\right)_z - \frac{M_z(t)-M_0}{T_2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Pulse Sequences and Measurement Techniques}
\subsubsection{The Refocused Spin Echo Sequence}
The Hahn Echo sequence consists of two pulses, the $\pi/2$ pulse and the $\pi$ pulse, separated in time by $\tau$: $\pi/2 - \tau - \pi - \tau - echo$. Initially, the macroscopic magnetization of the spin system is aligned along $\vec{B_0}$: $\vec{M}_0=M_Z~\vec{e_Z}$. The $\pi/2$ microwave pulse has such length $t_{\pi/2}$ and amplitude $B_1$ that, during the pulse, $\vec{M}$ nutates to the $xy$ plane, where it keeps precessing about $\vec{e_Z}$ after the end of the pulse. The difference in local environments for each individual spins in the spin packet, as well as the interactions between the spins, that make up $\vec{M}$, leads to slightly different precession frequencies $\omega_L^i$ of the spins. After some time $\tau$, the difference in the precession frequencies translates into the differences in phases so that the vector sum of the excited spins averages down to $\vec{0}$ for sufficiently long $\tau$. In other words, the excited spin packet dephases with time. The dephasing due to different local spin environments can be reversible if the deviations of the precession frequencies do not depend on time, as is the case for separated electrons in an inhomogeneous solid. In such case, a $\pi$ pulse can be applied to the spin system to flip every single spin in the dephased spin packet by 180$\deg$ in a plane containing $\vec{e}_Z$, so that the spins keep precessing in the $xy$ plane, but the direction of precession is inverted for them, leading to the effect that is opposite to the initial dephasing. So a $\tau$ after the $\pi$ pulse excites the spin packet, the accumulated phase differences become the smallest and the packet recovers its macroscopic magnetization $\vec{M}$ that oscillates in the $xy$ plane with $\langle\omega_L^i\rangle$ and can be detected. The recovered $\vec{M}$ at $t=\tau$ after the $\pi$ pulse is called the refocused spin echo. The difference in $\omega_L^i$ leads to a further dephasing of the considered spin packet and to the vanishing of $\vec{M}$.\\
\subsubsection{Spin Echo Decay and Phase Memory Time}


\subsubsection{Inversion Recovery and Spin-Lattice Relaxation Time}

\subsection{Broad-Band Excitation and Instantaneous Diffusion}
In Section /// it is shown that in a densely packed radical system, as in a TEMPO-Salen cathode film, the phase memory time can be shorter than $T_m\leq100$~ns. That is, the spin echo is decaying by $e\approx3$ times at $t=100$~ns. The short phase memory time limits the duration of the pulse sequence at which the echo is detectable. For a $\pi/2-\tau-\pi-\tau-echo$ sequence, with a hardware limitation on $\tau\geq t_d\approx100$~ns, the shortest realizable pulse sequence becomes longer than $t>200$~ns. By this time, the spin echo decreases by $e^2\approx7$ times and may be comparable to noise. The limitations imposed by the finite $T_m$ and $t_d$ force one to use shorter microwave pulses. 
\par
A short microwave pulse may have a spectral width comparable to the width of the observed spectrum. According to the Fourier theorem, the spectral width of a pulse is inversely proportional to the pulse length: $\Delta\omega\sim 1/t_p$. A spectrum of a 100~ns long rectangular pulse shown in Figure /// is ///MHz wide (FWHM).

\subsection{Instantaneous Diffusion in Charged pDiTBuS}
\label{S:ID}


We have seen that \rs{the} ESOC has a strong influence on the shape of the EDFS spectra. Furthermore, the EDFS spectra of pDiTBuS are quite different from the reference spectrum of TEMPOL in a \rs{dilute} frozen solution. 

High spin concentration in a pDiTBuS \rs{electrode suggests strong inter-spin dipolar couplings which cause instantaneous diffusion when probed with short (broad-band) microwave pulses~\cite{Toropov1998}, as it was observed in a PTMA/carbon mixture~\cite{Daniel2023}. Instantaneous diffusion caused by a broad-band microwave pulse shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_4}, dashed-red, manifests itself in an additional field-dependent spin relaxation} \ik{factor} $V(B_0)$, \ik{that alters the relative peak intensities in the \ik{echo-detected} spectrum. For spins uniformly distributed in space, $V(B_0)$} is described~\cite{Toropov1998} by Equation~\ref{eq:inst_diff}:

\begin{equation*}
V(B_0, 2\tau, C) =
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inst_diff}
 V_0(2\tau)\exp\left(-2\tau\frac{4\pi^2}{9\sqrt{3}}\gamma^2\hbar C \langle\sin^2(\theta/2)\rangle\right)
\end{equation}


with
\begin{equation*}
\langle\sin^2(\theta/2)\rangle=
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inst_diff2}
\frac{\int{\frac{B_1^2}{(B-B_0)^2+B_1^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{\gamma t_p}{2}\sqrt{(B-B_0)^2 +B_1^2}\right)    g(B)\mathrm{d}B}}   {\int{g(B)\mathrm{d}B}}
\end{equation}

where $B_0$ is the static magnetic field, $C$ is the concentration of spins, $\tau$ is the time between the first and second pulses in the microwave pulse sequence, $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electrons at resonance, $t_p$ is the duration of the second microwave pulse, $B_1$ is the amplitude of the second microwave pulse, $g(B)$ is the EDFS spectrum at $\tau=0$ that is not affected by the instantaneous diffusion. As the resulting spectral shape depends on the spin concentration, comparing spectra simulated according to Equation~\ref{eq:inst_diff} and measured spectra thus allows us to \ik{provide information about the} local spin concentrations. \ik{Since the spin echo of the most densely packed and thus quickly relaxing spins is not detectable with the given $t_d$, the regions of the highest spin concentration do not contribute to the EDFS spectrum. Thus, $C$ is lower than the \rs{true concentration of spins in the densely packed domains and can also be lower than the }average spin concentration $\langle n\rangle$ measured with cwEPR that is most sensitive to the quickly relaxing spins}.\\

\ik{We have used a 50~\si{\milli\Molar} solution of TEMPOL as a model system to explore how the excitation bandwidth affects instantaneous diffusion for nitroxides (see Section~\ref{si:TEMPOL_ID}, ESI). The EDFS spectrum recorded with $t_p=40$~ns and $\tau=120$~ns shows a distortion that corresponds to $C=9$~\si{\milli\Molar} , while for $t_p=1000$~ns no effect of instantaneous diffusion is observed.}
We simulated the \ik{undistorted} EDFS spectrum of TEMPOL using the Easyspin toolbox~\cite{Stoll2006} for Matlab and obtained the \q{$g$} \ik{matrix} and the hyperfine coupling tensor $A$ (for simulation details see Section~\ref{esi:fse_sims}, ESI). Then we simulated the EDFS spectr\ik{um} for pDiTBuS, ESOC~85\%, using the obtained parameters and Equation \ref{eq:inst_diff} with \ik{$t_p=40$~ns and} the concentration $C$ as a fit parameter. The result of the simulation with $C=3.1\times10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ = 50~\si{\milli\Molar}  is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_4}. At the same time, quantitative cwEPR yields a higher spin concentration for ESOC~85\%: $\langle n\rangle = (8\pm4)\times10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ = 130$\pm$70~\si{\milli\Molar}.\\

The ESOC~95\% spectrum cannot be simulated with Equation~\ref{eq:inst_diff} because of the increased intensity of the low-field peak. \ik{The ratio of the two remaining} peaks \ik{at ESOC~95\%} corresponds to $C=1.2\times10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ = 20~\si{\milli\Molar}  (see ESI, Section~\ref{esi:fse_sims_ID_full})\ik{, while cwEPR again yields a higher $\langle n\rangle=3\pm2\times10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}=50\pm30$~\si{\milli\Molar} }.

\subsection{EDFS in PDiTBuS at ESOC~85\% Affected by Instantaneous Diffusion}
The quick echo decay in pDiTBuS necessitates the usage of short microwave pulses that lead to ID. The asymmetric EDFS spectrum of pDiTBuS at 85\% ESOC was simulated considering the distortion of the standard TEMPO spectrum caused by the ID. The anisotropic relaxation of the spectral components is given by the equation \ref{eq:inst_diff} in the main text.

\subsection{Estimation of Local Spin Concentrations with Instantaneous Diffusion}



\section{Spin Relaxation in a charged pDiTBuS Cathode Film}
\label{S:RELAX_TIMES}

As we have shown in Section~\ref{S:ID}, the reason for the distorted spectral shape in pDiTBuS at ESOC~85\% is instantaneous diffusion that manifests itself in anisotropic spin relaxation which alters the \rs{relative} peak intensities. However, the spectrum \rs{for} ESOC~95\% cannot be simulated assuming just instantaneous diffusion (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S_SIM_FSE_SOC95_ID}, ESI). In order to gain additional information about the processes that may influence the shape of the EDFS spectra, we \ik{performed field-dependent measurements of \rs{the} spin relaxation times.}\\

Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_5}a shows the EDFS spectra of pDiTBuS for 85\% and 95\% ESOC as well as a reference sample (50 mM solution of TEMPOL in Dichloromethane:Acetonitrile (3:1) glass) measured at $T=5$~K. The spectra reveal markedly different intensities of the three hyperfine components.\\

Temperature 5~K. \q{Grayscale} represents the intensity in b)$-$e).}
	\label{fig:Figure_5}
\end{figure*}


\rs{The changed relative peak intensities in pDiTBuS may be the result of a magnetic field-dependent spin relaxation mechanism that manifests itself in a field-dependent phase memory time $T_m$~\cite{Schweiger2001}. The $T_m$ for pDiTBuS and for TEMPOL was probed in a field-swept echo decay experiment}. The echo decay transients for the three samples are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_5}b. A \q{Hahn echo} pulse sequence was used with a $\pi/2$ pulse length of 20~ns and variable pulse separation time $\tau\geq120$~ns. Spin echo was detected at 2$\tau$ after the $\pi/2$ pulse. Periodic oscillations in the echo decay transients correspond to the ESEEM effect from protons~\cite{Schweiger2001} with $\Delta\omega_L\approx15$~MHz, which are particularly pronounced for TEMPOL.\\ 

If the sample contains several different species (i.e. nitroxide radicals in different environments and/or different local concentration) with distinct spin-spin relaxation times, the echo decay transients may contain multiple decay components, so more than one $T_m$ can correspond to each field point. This effect is not considered when simulating the effect of instantaneous diffusion using Equation~\ref{eq:inst_diff}. To determine the number of decay components in the echo decay transients, we studied the poles of the Pad{\'e} approximation of the Taylor expansion of the Laplace transforms \ik{of the transients that is} known as the Pad{\'e}-Laplace method~\cite{Hellen2005} (see ESI, Section~\ref{pade_laplace_T2} for details). This analysis revealed only monoexponential spin echo decays for both 95\%~ESOC and 85\%~ESOC. We therefore assumed a monoexponential spin echo decay for pDiTBuS\ik{, though some faster relaxing components with \rs{$T_m<t_d$} might have decayed by the earliest achievable $\tau$}\rs{, as shown in Section~\ref{esi:dead_time}, ESI.} The detected decay times $T_m(B_0)$, extracted from fits of the background-corrected echo-decay curves, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_5}c as filled squares with \q{the grayscale} representing the amplitude of the corresponding fit component. \q{As expected, $T_m$ is significantly larger for 95\% than for 85\% ESOC, consistent with the weaker spin-spin couplings in the fully charged film. Further, we note that the field-dependence of $T_m$ is more pronounced for 95\% ESOC, with $T_m\geq200$~ns for the $m_I=+1$ hyperfine component. This anisotropy in $T_m$ results in an increased intensity of the low-field peak, which is in line with the observation that we cannot describe the 95\% ESOC spectrum assuming only instantaneous diffusion (see Section~\ref{S:ID}).} The transient fits and the residuals are shown in Section~\ref{pade_laplace_T2}, ESI.\\

We attempted to reproduce the pDiTBuS spectra from a standard nitroxide spectrum by considering anisotropic transient decay of the spectral intensity at \ik{$t=\tau=120$~ns for each $B_0$} with the measured $T_m(B_0)$. However, this approach did not allow us to reconstruct the pDiTBuS spectra for neither 85\%, nor 95\%~ESOC.\\

% The measured $T_m$ is more anisotropic for the 95\%~SOC.\\ 


It was recently shown, that densely packed TEMPO radicals in a TEMPO-containing, non-conductive polymer PTMA, intermixed into \q{an} amorphous carbon mesh, show multi\ik{ple} spin-lattice relaxation times $T_1$ because of different types of contact between the TEMPO radicals and the conductive additive in the TEMPO/carbon composite~\cite{Daniel2023}. In order to find out whether such behavior can also be observed for \ik{the porous} pDiTBuS film, we measured spin-lattice relaxation times $T_1$ with an inversion-recovery pulse sequence ($\pi-\tau-\pi/2-\tau_{fix}-\pi-\tau_{fix}-echo$) with variable $\tau$ (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_5}d). The Pad{\'e}-Laplace analysis yielded one decay component for TEMPOL and two decay components for pDiTBuS both at 85\%~ESOC and 95\%~ESOC (see ESI, Section~\ref{esi:pade_laplace_T1} for details). The $T_1$ for charged pDiTBuS is \w{on the same order as for }TEMPOL and splits in two rather broad distributions with \w{similar} intensities (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_5}e). \q{Similar as in the case of $T_m$, also $T_1$ is larger for 95\% than for 85\% ESOC. Irrespective of the ESOC there is no significant field dependence of $T_1$, in contrast to what is observed for the TEMPOL reference sample.\\} 

Daniel et al.\q{~\cite{Daniel2023}} concluded that separate distributions of $T_1$ correspond to different \ik{binding between TEMPO and the carbon mesh, representing the} quality of electrical contact between TEMPO and the conductive additive. With the observed distribution of $T_1$ and considering the two-component cwEPR spectral contributions for charged pDiTBuS \ik{(``broad'' and ``dilute'' components, cf. Section~\ref{esi:cw_sims}, ESI)}, we suggest \rs{that two types of domains could exist} in a \ik{partially} charged pDiTBuS film \rs{as well. These two} \ik{morphologies \rs{may correspond to} \q{``conductive''} domains with shorter $T_1$, where TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ are close to the conductive pNiSalen backbone, and \q{``non-conductive''} domains with longer $T_1$, where TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ are separated from pNiSalen}. \rs{We note, however, that based on the experimental data presented here, this interpretation is rather speculative.} \ik{The detected $T_1$ values for pDiTBuS may also correspond to one distribution, as the separation between the $T_1$ values is comparable to \rs{the widths of their distributions}}.\\%NiSalen backbone.\\

\subsection{Temperature Dependence of Pulse Spectra of Charged pDiTBuS}
Spin relaxation times usually depend on temperature\ik{\cite{Schweiger2001}}. We measured EDFS of charged pDiTBuS at \rs{5~K} and at \rs{80~K} to see how faster spin relaxation affects the spectral shape. Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_6} shows EDFS spectra for pDiTBuS \ik{ charged to} ESOC~95\% (a) and \ik{to} ESOC~85\% (b) \ik{at 80~K (solid) and at 5~K (dashed)}. At 80~K an overnight scan was required to obtain a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio, \rs{whereas} at 5~K the spectrum was recorded in a few minutes. The spectral intensities at different temperatures were \ik{scaled} \rs{such that} the high-field $m_I=-1$ peak \rs{has the same intensity}. Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_6} clearly shows that the relative intensities of the peaks change with temperature for both ESOC. At higher temperatures the EDFS spectrum of pDiTBuS has a peak ratio closer to that of dilute TEMPOL that corresponds to \ik{a} lower spin concentration\ik{,} according to Equation~\ref{eq:inst_diff}. The influence of the temperature \ik{increase} on the spectral shape is stronger for the \ik{lower,} 85\% ESOC.

\end{figure}


The overall relaxation times in the film decrease with \ik{increasing} temperature, but the dead time of the spectrometer ($t_d=120$~ns) does not change. Therefore, at a given temperature, only \ik{spins with $T_m>t_d$} contribute to the signal. At higher temperature only the weakly coupled spins \ik{(with the longest $T_m$)} are detectable, which results in a spectral shape that is \q{less affected by instantaneous diffusion and thus }closer to a dilute nitroxide solution.\\

\subsection{\ik{Limitation on Shortest Detectable $T_m$ by the Spectrometer Dead Time}}
\label{esi:dead_time}

\ik{If a system exhibits multiple phase memory times $T_m$, the spin echo from the species with short memory times may decay below the noise level at a given pulse separation $\tau$. Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S25} illustrates the spin echo intensity in a two-component system with $T_m^1=100$~ns and $T_m^2=25$~ns in dependence on the pulse separation $\tau$. The fast relaxing component with $T_m^2=25$~ns decays below the noise level after the dead time of $t_d=100$~ns.}

\section{Pad{\'e}-Laplace Deconvolution of Polyexponential Decay Signals}
\label{sec:pade-laplace}
The echo decay and inversion recovery transients measured in the corresponding experiments may contain multiple exponential decay components. The conventional method of determining the distribution of the decay components in a transient decay is the Laplace inversion, where the signal in the time domain $s(t)$ is converted into its Laplace image $L(p)=\int\limits_{0}^{+\infty}s(t)e^{-pt}\mathrm{d}t$ in the time-constant domain $p=1/t$, where the peaks of $L(p)$ give the decay constants that make up the signal. However, for the noisy signal, the direct calculation of the Laplace transform brings in artifacts that drastically vary with the noise. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the recorded data makes it difficult to apply the Laplace inversion to determine the number of the decay components, as the Laplace transform is unstable at that SNR. \\ 


The Pad{\'e}-Laplace method comes useful for analyzing noisy polyexponential decays as it was demonstrated in Ref.~\cite{Hellen_2005}. The idea of the Pad{\'e}-Laplace method is to analyze the Pad{\'e} approximation of the Taylor expansion of the $L(p)$ in the vicinity of one of the expected decay constants $p_0$, rather than considering the $L(p)$ fully. This way of signal decomposition is stable against the noise for SNR$<$10 (see Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S7}). The number of exponents detected by the Pad{\'e}-Laplace method as well as their locations in the $p$ space may vary depending on the expansion point $p_0$. We considered $p_0=1/t_{1/2}$ where $t_{1/2}$ is the time at which the signal amplitude halves.\\

We implemented the following algorithm to detect the number of exponents in the decaying transient $s(t)$:\\

First, a point $p_0=1/t_{1/2}$ was chosen, at which $s(t)$ halves.\\

Then, 11 coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the Laplace transform $L(p)$ were calculated in the vicinity of $p \rightarrow p_0$\\

\begin{equation}
L(p)\vert_{p \rightarrow p_0} = \sum_{n=0}^{11} d_i (p-p_0)^i
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
d_i = \frac{1}{i!}\left(\frac{d^{(i)}L}{dp^{(i)}}\right)_{p=p0}
\end{equation}
where the derivatives $\frac{d^{(i)}L}{dp^{(i)}}$ are computed numerically at the point $p=p_{0}$ from the discrete signal $s(t) = (t_j,f_j),~j=1~...~M$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^{(i)}L}{dp^{(i)}}= \sum_{j=2}^{M-1}(-t_j)^ie^{(-p_0t_j)}f_j + \frac{1}{2}\left((-t_1)^ie^{(-p_0t_1)}f_1+(-t_M)^ie^{(-p_0t_M)}f_M \right)
\end{equation}


Then the Taylor expansion for $L(p)$ was approximated in the vicinity of $p_0$ with the Pad{\'e} polynomials a(p) and b(p) of orders $n=5$ and $n=6$ respectively:\\

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pade}
L(p)\vert_{p \rightarrow p_0} = d_0+d_1(p-p_0)+\dots+d_{11}(p-p_0)^{11}=\frac{a_0 + a_1(p-p_0) + \dots + a_5(p-p_0)^5}  {1 + b_1(p-p_0)+ \dots+ b_6(p-p_0)^6}
\end{equation}

The equation \ref{eq:pade} is multiplied by the the denominator and the prefactors at $(p-p_0)^{n}$ for $n=6\dots11$ are compared. This defines a system of linear equations on coefficients $b_i$:\\


\begin{equation}\label{eq:matrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    d_{5} & d_{4} & d_{3} & d_2 & d_1 & d_0\\
    d_6 & d_5 & d_4 & d_3 & d_2 & d_1\\
    d_7 & d_6 & d_5 & d_4 & d_3 & d_2\\
    d_8 & d_7 & d_6 & d_5 & d_4 & d_3\\
    d_9 & d_8 & d_7 & d_6 & d_5 & d_4\\
    d_{10} & d_9 & d_8 & d_7 & d_6 & d_5
  \end{pmatrix}
       \begin{pmatrix}
   b_1\\
   b_2\\
   b_3\\
   b_4\\
   b_5\\
   b_6
   \end{pmatrix}
  =
    \begin{pmatrix}
   -d_6\\
   -d_7\\
   -d_8\\
   -d_9\\
   -d_{10}\\
   -d_{11}
   \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

From \ref{eq:matrix}, $b_i$ are found. The coefficients $a_i$ are found from ${d}$ and ${b}$.\\

Finally, the Pad{\'e} approximation $P=\frac{a}{b}$ is constructed and its poles are analyzed. The position of the poles reveal the decay constants. The residues at the poles may give the amplitudes of the decay components, but this was not used in the present study.

\subsection{Pad{\'e}-Laplace Deconvolution of the Echo-Decay and Inversion-Recovery Transients}
\label{pade_laplace_T2}
We used the Pad{\'e}-Laplace method to determine the number of the decay constants in the signals and used multiexponential fits to adjust the decay constants and their amplitudes. For the echo decay transients the best fits were monoexponential fits, even though the Pade-Laplace analysis initially showed biexponential behavior for pDiTBuS with major contribution from the fast decay constants in the order of the detector's dead time. All recorded echo decay transients contain oscillations due to the ESEEM effect. The oscillations were excluded from the analysis as shown in the 'fit area' on the plots in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S9}, Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S11} and Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S13}.

\subsection{Detection of Domains with Poor Conductivity}
\label{sec:domains_distinction_by_relaxation}

\subsection{Towards Electron Resonance Imaging of Spin Concentrations in Battery Electrodes}
The local spin concentrations that are present in an electrode film can be obtained by the time-constant-domain analysis of the echo decay transients, as it was described in \ref{sec:domains_distinction_by_relaxation}. One can extend this characterization technique and obtain a spatially resolved image of the spin concentrations inside the battery electrode by encoding the position at which the sample is excited with a gradient of the magnetic field. A strongly asymmetric ferromagnetic wedge~\cite{SternGerlach1922} can be used to superimpose a gradient of $B_0$ in a chosen direction so one can not only measure the spin concentrations that are present in the electrode, but also to locate the electrochemically inactive domains and to visualize the conductive paths throughout the electrode, analogously to the NMR imaging. The difficulty on the way to apply this visualization technique lies in the large excitation bandwidth of the pulse sequence.
\par
Let the cathode film of width $l$ be oriented along the static magnetic field so that $B_0$ lies in the film plane. Let the $B_0$ be fixed at the maximum intensity of the FSE spectrum, say, $B_0 = B_0^{res}=342$~mT. Let $B_0$ be homogeneous within the film length, which is normally the case for the EPR resonator. Let the film contain a distribution of spin concentrations within its length $C_{min}<C(z)<C_{max}$. With the homogeneous $B_0$, the microwave pulse will excite the entire film length and the spin echo signal will contain spin echoes from all length elements of the film, that correspond to all $C(z)$. The inversion recovery transient will contain the time constants from all length elements of the film $T_1(z)$. With the Pad{\'e}-Laplace analysis one recovers the distribution of the concentrations within the film $C_i$, but since the $B_0$ is homogeneous, the information on the position $z_i$ at which the domains are located, is lost. 
\par
Let now the $B_0$ to be linearly increasing from $B_0(z=-l/2) = B_0^{res}-\Delta B_0$ at one side of the film to $B_0(z=l/2)=B_0^{res}+ \Delta B_0$ by the other side of the film, so that for a given length element $dl$ the inhomogeneity of $B_0$ is $dB/dl = \frac{B(z=l/2)-B(z=-l/2)}{l}$. In the center of the film (at $z=0$) the $B_0$ is resonant and the spin echo signal will be generated, while from the other positions of the film the magnetic field will be non-resonant and no spin echo signal will be generated. Let the width of the EPR spectrum be $\Delta B_{FWHM}=8$~mT and that to define the probed length element $\Delta l$ with the given $B_0$ gradient. $\frac{\Delta B_{FWHM}}{\Delta l} = \frac{B(z=l/2)-B(z=-l/2)}{l}$, so the spatial resolution is 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ERI_resolution}
\frac{\Delta l}{l} = \frac{\Delta B_{FWHM}}{B(z=l/2)-B(z=-l/2)}
\end{equation}

With the spectral width of $\Delta B_{FWHM}\leq8$~mT and the film width of $l\leq3\times10^{-1}$~cm to get 
256 points per film length one needs a $B_0$ gradient of $dB/dl \geq 256*8/0.3 \geq 6.8$~[T/cm] which is a realistic value for a typical Stern-Gerlach apparatus~\cite{SternGerlach1922,Liang_2020}.
