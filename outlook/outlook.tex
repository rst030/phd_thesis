\chapter{Conclusions and Outlook}

\paragraph*{}
What hasnt worked so far is the EDMR. It would be super cool to see the signal, but my devices don't live that long. LOD also did not work up to now. Adjusting the pulse train rate to the eigenfrequency of the ENDOR coils turned out to be an irresistible obstacle.
\paragraph*{}
\raw{EDMR is allowing to manipulate the spin of an electron that tunnels through a disordered media such as the amorphous silicon in a solar cell, through intertwined fragments of conjugated polymers in an organic solar cell or an organic field-effect transistor.}\\
