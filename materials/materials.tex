In this chapter, the process of charging of an electrochemical cell is detailed, redox conductive polymers are presented and a preparation of organic electrochemical half-cells suitable for electron spin resonance spectroscopy is described. Necessary electrochemical characterization techniques are introduced.

\section{Organic Electrochemical Cells}


\subsection{Cell Electrodes}
The electrode of an ORB is made of a conductive (metallic) lead and a layer of redox active (organic) molecules adsorbed to the metal~\cite{Boiziau1988} with a bond that allows for electrical conductivity. The charge transfer between the conductor and the redox active molecule in the electrode can be described in terms of the molecular orbitals of the cathode molecule and the Fermi energy of the electrode~\cite{DOM,Wu_2023,Boiziau1988}. The oxidation potential of a molecule correlates with the energy of its highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) ~\cite{Sworakowski2018,Wu_2023}. A simple organic cathode consists of a metallic lead and one redox active molecule attached to it. When the electric potential $V$ of the metallic lead is set lower than the HOMO of the cathode molecule, and the other end of the molecule is ``grounded'' with the electrolyte to the anode, an electron can be transferred from the cathode molecule to the lead. The cathode molecule loses an electron, acquires a positive charge and its electronic energy lowers. The induction of a positive charge in the molecule simultaneously attracts a negative ion from the electrolyte. No charge transfer happens between the ion and the charged molecule, but the movement of the ion causes a DC current to flow through the electrochemical cell, closing the electrical circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~a). In a cathode containing more than one layer of redox active molecules, together with the polymer-metal charge transfer, an intermolecular charge transfer has to take place in order to oxidize the next molecular layer.\\ 
A symmetric reaction on the anode is reducing the anode molecule and changing its state from HOMO to LUMO. These two redox reactions describe the charging of an electrochemical cell. The opposite reaction is discharging. Upon discharging, the cathode is reduced and the anode is oxidized. Excessive charging and discharging may lead to an irreversible chemical reaction in the electrodes and the reactions to the electrolyte, that is undesirable, so the $V_{OC}$ of the cell has to be observed during its operation.\\


\subsection{Three-Electrode Cell}
It is possible to study the redox reaction only at one electrode of the cell, e.g. the cathode, using a chemically inert second electrode. A cell with only one redox active electrode is called a half-cell. The studied electrode is called the working electrode (WE). The opposite electrode, called the reference electrode (RE), is made of a known material that maintains a constant composition and has a reproducible potential difference at the electrode-electrolyte interface called the standard potential. Any change in the potential difference between the WE and RE of the half-cell setup is therefore attributed to the processes in the WE only~\cite{Bard_book,Reddy_book}.\\
However, when a half-cell is being charged and the current is flowing through the RE, a chemical reaction can take place at the RE, changing its composition and the standard potential. The chemical reaction on the RE changes the parameters of the half-cell and shifts the observed potential difference unpredictably~\cite{Bard_book,DOM}. For this reason, a three-electrode half-cell shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~c) is used for characterizing battery electrodes that are designed for significant charging currents.\\

In the three-electrode half-cell, the charging current is applied between the WE and a chemically inert counter electrode (CE). The oxidation of the WE is accompanied by the formation of a double layer of the electrolyte molecules at the surface of the CE. The electric potential of the WE is measured as a potential difference between the WE and the calibrated RE, inserted in the electrolyte close to the CE. The potential difference between WE and RE is measured with a high impedance voltmeter that ensures minimal charge flow through the RE. That is, RE does not undergo a chemical reaction during the charging of WE, its chemical environment does not change during the experiment and the measured potential difference between WE and RE corresponds to the potential of the WE. Due to the finite dimensions of the electrodes and the finite thickness of the double layer around the CE, the RE cannot be inserted at the position of the CE, so the measured potential has a constant offset as the electrolyte between the points where WE, RE and CE are inserted, acts as a voltage divider~\cite{Bard_book}.\\

\subsection{Reference Electrode}
The potential $E$ of the cell electrode is measured with respect to a calibrated, inert RE. The potential of the RE is chosen as $E=0$. A general RE is the standard hydrogen electrode (Pt/H$_2$/H$^+$), or SHE. The main difference between the various RE is their operation range and a constant potential shift with respect to the SHE depending on the workfunction of the RE material. The couple Ag/AgNO$_3$ is commonly used in electrochemistry~\cite{Bard_book}. It exhibits a shift of 0.7991~V vs. SHE. For the couple Ag/AgCl, the shift is 0.2223~V against SHE~\cite{Bard_book,DOM}, although these values can only be used if the electrode configuration is strictly equivalent to the one used for determining them. In other cases, like in the case with a thin electrolyte layer in the modified sample tube, the exact shifts of the RE might differ~\cite{DOM}.\\

\subsection{Electrolyte}

Electrolyte is an ionic conductor~\cite{Bard_book} - an electrically conductive solution of oppositely charged ions that are typically products of dissociation of the corresponding salts. The dissociation of a salt in a solvent implies that the solvent has high enough dielectric constant $\varepsilon$ to polarize the salt molecule and to separate it into a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion) by creating solvation shells around them. High mobility of the electrolyte ions is needed for the efficient ion diffusion into the battery electrodes, so that the redox reaction can take place along the entire surface of the electrode material that is soaked into the electrolyte. The ionic mobility also influences the Ohmic losses and polarization of electric double layers, governing, together with the electronic properties of the electrodes, the power density of a battery~\cite{Neueder2014}.\\


\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/materials/electrolytes.pdf}
	\caption{Ionic salt (ET$_4$NBF$_4$, a) and the corresponding solvents (Acetonitrile (b) and Propylen Carbonate~(c) for liquid electrolytes. Ionic liquid (TMIMTFSI, d)) and polymer matrix (PVDF, e)) for the gel electrolyte.}
	\label{fig:electrolytes}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Liquid Electrolyte}
Tetraetylammonium tetrofluoroborate (Et$_4$NBF$_4$, Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes}~a) is a crystalline salt that dissociates into a Et$_4$N$^-$ cation and a BF$_4^-$ anion in polar solvents such as Acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN, Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes},b) and Propylene Carbonate (C$_4$H$_6$O$_3$, Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes},c). Et$_4$NBF$_4$ is a small molecule with a relatively high dissociation energy, so the solvents have high dielectric constants ($\varepsilon\approx40$ for Acetonitrile and $\varepsilon\approx64$ for Propylene Carbonate). Propylene Carbonate has higher density than Acetonitrile, has higher viscosity and is less volatile. A 100~mM solution of Et$_4$NBF$_4$ in Acetonitrile or in Propylene Carbonate ensures sufficient ionic transport for the organic electrochemical cells described later in this section.

\subsubsection{Polymer-based Gel Electrolyte}
The use of ionic liquids and the suitable polymer matrix allows for fabrication solid-state electrolytes that are used for making organic electrochemical neurons~\cite{Harikesh2022} and solid-state Li batteries~\cite{Pang2021}. PVDF (Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes}~e) was used as a polymer matrix. TMIMTFSI (Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes}~d) was the ionic liquid. The polymer grains were dissolved in Chloroform at 80~$^{\deg}$C and the ionic liquid was mixed in at a ratio $1:4:20$ (polymer : ionic liquid : solvent). The polymer electrolyte was used to manufacture an all-polymer organic radical battery described later in this section.




\subsection{Characteristics of Rechargeable Batteries}
Depending on the redox potentials of the used electrodes, the output voltage of a cell ($V_{OC}$) ranges between 0 and 5~V~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater}. Most applications require higher voltages, so multiple cells are connected in series to form a battery.%For a commercial Li-polymer cell, the safe operating limits are $2.8$~V~$<V_{OC}<4.2$~V.\\

\paragraph{Energy and power density, C-rate and State Of Charge}
The capacity of a cell $C$ is measured in mAh. It is the maximal electric charge that can be stored in it. Different electrode materials can store different amounts of charge depending on their chemical composition and microscopic structure. Due to the unavoidable losses of charge caused by the finite shunting resistance between the cell electrodes, one distinguishes between the charging capacity and the discharging capacity. The capacity of 1~g of an electro-active material is its gravimetric capacity, it is measured in mAhg$^{-1}$. The volumetric capacity is the corresponding value with respect to the volume of the material that is measured in mAhl$^{-1}$. The energy stored in a cell is a product of its capacity and its voltage. The ratio of the stored energy to the volume of a cell is its energy density. The energy density of a cell depends on the capacity of the electrodes and the potential difference between the electrodes~\cite{Liu2016}. The fraction of charge left in a cell with respect to the full charge that can be stored in that cell in percent is called the state of charge or SoC. The SoC of a fully charged battery is 100\%.\\
\par
A battery is typically charged with a constant DC current. The magnitude of the charging (or discharging) current relative to the battery capacity determines the rate at which a battery is charged (or discharged). The charging rate, or C-rate is the charge or discharge current in Amps divided by the battery capacity in Ampere-hours. For a modern rechargeable Li-polymer battery a safe charging C-rate cannot exceed 1~C~\cite{Zhang2022}. That means, the safe charging time for a Li-polymer battery cannot be shorter than 1 hour. The discharge rate of the same battery, however, can be as high as 100~C that corresponds to a discharge current larger than the charging current by a factor of 100. The power that a battery can deliver depends on its maximal discharging C rate and equals to the product of its short-circuit current and its voltage. The organic radical batteries can have charging and discharging C rates close to 3000~C and gravimetric discharge capacities upto 111~mAhg$^{-1}$~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,friebe2017_topcurrchem,Zens2022,Vereshchagin2022,Kulikov2023,Tarascon2001}. While the capacities of the organic electrode materials are smaller than for the Li metal electrodes (3850 mAh$g^{-1}$), the organic electrode materials allow for much higher C rates that already exceed the C rate of the conventional inorganic cells by orders of magnitude~\cite{Diouf2019}.

\paragraph{State Of Health}
The capacity of a battery may decrease upon repeated charge-discharge cycling, especially at high C rates~\cite{Guan2018,Ouyang2020}, over-discharge~\cite{Ma2020} and extreme environmental conditions~\cite{Zhang2022}. The ratio of the maximum battery charge to its rated as-manufactured capacity expressed in percent is called state of health (SoH). SoH is a measure of the remaining life time of a battery. The decrease in SoH indicates the intensified irreversible processes that take place in an electrochemical cell, such as a physical damage~\cite{Fu_2015}, degradation of the electrode material~\cite{Ma2020,Kulikov2022}, side reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface~\cite{Tarascon2001}, or decomposition of the electrolyte~\cite{Fang_2021}. A damaged cell, especially that can store significant amount of charge, represents a major hazard~\cite{Ma2020}. Accurate measurements of SoH can prevent hazardous battery malfunctions such as explosions.

\section{Electrochemical Instrumentation}
\subsection{Cyclic Voltammogram}
The complete electrochemical behavior of a redox active molecular system can be obtained with a series of transient current responses to potentials, applied step-wise to the electrochemical cell containing the system. However, for a basic electrochemical characterization, a current response during a linearly swept potential is sufficient~\cite{Bard_book}. During the linear-potential-sweep chronoamperometry, or linear sweep voltammetry, the potential $E$ applied to the electrochemical cell is swept in a linear manner between the values $E_{min}$ and $E_{max}$, upwards and downwards, with a rate $v~($mVs$^{-1})$: $E(t) = E_0\pm vt$. During the sweep, the current is recorded as a function of the applied potential as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}~b).\\ 

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/CV_pDiTBuS.pdf}
	\caption{a): Electrochemical setup for measuring a cyclic voltammogram. b): Linear voltage sweep at a 50~mVs$^{-1}$ rate. c) Cyclic voltammogram of an electro-active polymer cathode film. Oxidation and reduction of the charge-bearing fragments of the film corresponds to the $A$ and $A^\prime$ redox peaks, respectively. Oxidation and reduction of the conductive polymer backbone of the film corresponds to peaks $B$ and $B^\prime$. The standard oxidation potential of the charge-bearing fragments, $E_{1/2}^A$, lies close to the standard oxidation potential of the backbone, $E_{1/2}^B$.}
	\label{fig:CV_DiTBuS}
\end{figure}

\par
The resulting plot $i(E)$ is the cyclic voltammogram (CV). The upward potential sweep corresponds to the anodic, or charging branch of the CV and the downward sweep corresponds to the cathodic, or discharge branch. A CV of a three-electrode electrochemical cell with an electro-active polymer film on the WE is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}~c). When $E$ reaches the oxidation potential of the working electrode, charge transfer happens and the current through the cell increases. This corresponds to the oxidation peak in the anodic branch. The width of the peak is determined by the temperature of the cell and the number of electrons $n$ transferred in a single oxidation reaction ($n=2$ for poly-di-TEMPO-Salen, the redox conductive polymer discribed in Section~\ref{sec:ORB_materials}). The negative current peak in the cathodic branch of the CV curve corresponds to the reduction of the WE. The difference between the potentials of the oxidation and reduction peaks arises because of the finite electric capacity of the electro-active film and a finite voltage sweep rate. For higher sweep rates the difference in peak potentials is higher, as the scanning time becomes comparable to the RC time constant of the cell.\\


\par
The area under the anodic branch can be used to calculate the charge that was transferred from the WE upon its reduction from the fully oxidized state. The applied voltage is swept at a known rate, so the anodic branch $i(E)$ can be plotted vs. time $i(t)$, hence the transferred charge equals to the integral under the curve: $q = \int_{E_{max}}^{E_{min}}i(t)dt$. By knowing the $q$ and considering the corresponding chemical reaction (how many electrons are transferred for one molecule) one gets the amount of substance in the electrode $\nu=qF$~[mol] and the number of electrochemically active molecules $N_{echem}=\nu N_A$ with $F\approx9.47\times10^4$~C$\times$mol$^{-1}$ for the Faraday constant and $N_A\approx6.02\times10^{23}$~mol$^{-1}$ for the Avogadro constant~\cite{NIST}. Given the molecular weight $M$, the total mass of the electrochemically active molecules of the film can be calculated. Together with the information on the density of the film, its dimensions can be estimated. However, as demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:quantitative_EPR} and in Refs.~\cite{Vereshchagin2022,Kulikov2022,Kulikov2023}, the number of electrochemically active molecules in a polymer cathode film can be much lower than the total number of molecules in it.  

\subsection{Charge-Discharge Cycling}
\label{sec:echem_charging}
\begin{figure}[h]
\center
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/GCD_principle_pDiTBuS.pdf}

	\label{fig:GCD}
\end{figure}

A constant-current characterization technique called galvanostatic potentiometry~\cite{Bard_book} can be used in combination with the cyclic voltammetry to study the redox behavior of the electrochemical system quantitatively. The setup for galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~a). The cell is excited with a DC current as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~b) and the potential of the cell is measured as a function of time, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c). Upon positive (charging) current, the working electrode of the cell is oxidized. The voltage required to provide the charging current gradually increases, resulting a galvanostatic charging curve shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c). The shape of the charging curve can be approximated by considering two major effects: the Faradic current and the displacement current~\cite{Bard_book}. The Faradic current is caused by the oxidation of the redox active species in the WE. It defines the plateau regions in the middle of the charging and discharging curves. The displacement current is the result of the charging of a double layer around the WE and CE. It explains the capacitor-like response of the charging and discharging curves before and after the plateau region~\cite{Bard_book}. In this regard the electrochemical cell with only one redox active electrode can be treated as a pseudocapacitor~\cite{He_2022,Vereshchagin2022}. When all redox active species of the WE are oxidized, the voltage required for providing the charging current steeply increases, that is seen in the end of the charging curves in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c) and ~\ref{fig:GCD_DiTBuS}. Eventually, upon charging, the potential of the cell grows beyond the oxidation peak of the WE, according to the cyclic voltammogram (Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}). Then the charging is stopped and the transferred charge is calculated from the charging time. The same strategy is applied for the discharging curve to determine the discharging capacity of the cell. The reproducibility of the charge-discharge curve indicates the stability of the electrochemical cell. SoH of the cell can be estimated by observing the decrease in the period of the charge-discharge curve.\\

\par
A cell can also be charged by applying a constant voltage to it and by letting the applied current to change upon charging, this mode is called potentiostatic chronoamperometry. A positive voltage applied to a discharged cell will initially result in a large current. Upon potentiostatic charging, the charging current decreases with time, as most of the molecules in the electrode are oxidized and the cell voltage approaches the applied voltage.





\section{Organic Electrode Materials}
\label{sec:ORB_materials}
ORB based on redox polymers containing stable radicals~\cite{nakahara2002_cpl} have been shown to compete with or even outperform  conventional Li based batteries in terms of power densities~\cite{IWASA2007} with the additional benefit of being free from rare precursors, inheriting mechanical properties of plastics and electrical properties of semiconductors~\cite{friebe2017_topcurrchem,Casado2021,Goujon2021}. Advanced molecular design techniques allow for tuning of the electrochemical properties of the redox polymers~\cite{Janoschka2017}, that brings in a rich variety of organic energy storage materials~\cite{Xie2021,Vereshchagin2022,Janoschka2017a} and creates a large room for their optimization. 

\subsection{Semiconducting Polymers}
\par
The key for polymer conductivity is the $\pi$ - conjugated network, a system of overlapping $\pi$ orbitals of carbon in a chain of alternating single and double carbon-carbon bonds that allows for charge delocalization along the polymer backbone~\cite{heeger_polymers,Koehler_book,Casado_2021_book}. An example of a $\pi$ conjugated network is polyacetylene shown in Figure~\ref{fig:homo-lumo}. Polyacetylene exhibits a band structure in the electron energy levels (between its band-like $\pi$ and $\pi^\star$ orbitals) and represents a molecular semiconductor~\cite{heeger_polymers}.\\
\par
A simple organic molecule, ethylene, shown in Figure \ref{fig:ethylene}, contains two carbon atoms and four hydrogens. Each carbon atom has six electrons. The four unpaired electrons of carbon - one at the $2s$ orbital and three at the $2p$ orbital - interact to form two $sp^2$- hybridized orbitals and one unhybridized $p_z$ orbital, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pi-bond}. 

\begin{figure} [h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.85\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/ethylene.png}
\caption{Ethylene molecule with $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bonds \cite{Koehler_book}.}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Formation of a band gap in a conjugated polymer. Figures adapted from~\cite{cambridge}.}
	  \label{fig:conjugation}
\end{figure}

The hybridized $sp^2$ orbitals form $\sigma$ bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. The $\sigma$ bonds keep the carbon atoms together in the molecule. The remaining $p_z$ orbitals interact with each other and form a $\pi$ bond so that $p_z$ electrons are shared between the carbon atoms. The interaction between $p_z$ orbitals results in two molecular orbitals, the bonding ($\pi$) and the antibonding ($\pi^*$) orbitals~\cite{Dermtroeder_3}. A $\pi$ orbital is described by a symmetric wavefunction and $\pi^*$ orbital is described by an antisymmetric wavefunction. A $\pi$ orbital has a lower energy than $\pi^*$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:homo-lumo}. The symmetric $\pi$ orbital is more energetically favorable, so the electrons occupy it at the equilibrium. Because of that, the $\pi$ orbital is called the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and $\pi^*$ is the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO). There is a forbidden energy zone between HOMO and LUMO which is equivalent to a bandgap of a semiconductor.\\ 
\par
In a longer molecule, the $\pi$/$\pi^*$ states are delocalized over many carbon atoms. This is known as conjugation and the number of conjugated atoms determine the conjugation length. As conjugation length increases, the HOMO and LUMO levels for each pair of carbon atoms in the molecule become slightly different. In a polymer with a very large conjugation length, many energy levels around HOMO and LUMO overlap which forms energy bands, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:conjugation}~\cite{Koehler_book,cambridge}. At a finite temperature, there is a non-zero population of electrons above the LUMO level which allows them to move freely along the chain of overlapping $p_z$ orbitals and makes conjugated polymers conductive~\cite{heeger_polymers}.\\

\par Even though conjugated polymers have band-like energy structure and a bandgap, their charge-transport properties are different from crystalline semiconductors. Real polymer chains have finite lengths that brings disorder to an organic semiconductor (Figure \ref{fig:hopping}~a). The disorder causes localization of electronic wave functions, that is known as charge carrier trapping, and hinders the electrical transport in semiconductors~\cite{Yi2016,Meier2013}, so when an external electric field is applied, a charge needs additional energy to hop from one localized state to another for electric current to flow (Figure \ref{fig:hopping}~b). In Figure \ref{fig:hopping}~c) it is shown how a charge moves through a disordered organic semiconductor choosing the optimal path in both energy and space domains. This mode of charge transport is referred to as the hopping transport~\cite{Tessler2009}.\\

\begin{figure} [h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/hopping.png}
\caption{Transport of charge through localized energy sites distributed both in space (a) and in energy (b). The line describes a possible path that a charge carrier takes while hopping through a conjugated polymer under an external electric field. The trajectory is affected by the energy distribution (c). The picture is taken from Ref.~\cite{Tessler2009}.}
\label{fig:hopping}
\end{figure}

Redox conductive polymers (RCP), besides being conductive, are able to store a charge. Typically, a RCP has a large concentration of charge bearing fragments that are interconnected by the polymer backbone~\cite{Casado_2021_book}. Storage of charge implies that the stored charge carriers are localized and cannot freely move within the polymer, unless the appropriate electric field is applied to release them to the conjugated network. In this regard, the charge bearing fragments of an RCP can be viewed as charge carrier traps. The high concentration of the charge carrier traps in a conductive polymer makes neither the hopping-charge transport model~\cite{Sato2018}, nor the band-like transport model~\cite{Koehler_book} applicable to describe the electric transport in these materials, so alternative models were developed.



\par
\subsection{TEMPO$^{\bullet}$}
TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:molecules}~a) is a small molecule and a stable radical that can undergo a fast and reversible redox reaction between TEMPO$^\bullet$ and TEMPO$^+$~\cite{Wang2019}, with an electron self-exchange rate constant of $k_{ex}\approx10^{6-8}$ M$^{-1}$~s$^{-1}$~\cite{Chatgilialoglu2012}. TEMPO is an inexpensive organic compound~\cite{Vereshchagin2022} produced from acetone with liquid ammonia, hydrazine and peroxide~\cite{Casado_2021_book}. TEMPO radicals are widely used as spin labels in the studies of biological systems with electron spin resonance~\cite{Bordignon2017}, because the unpaired electron of TEMPO$^\bullet$ has a well defined spectral signature that changes when the local environment of a TEMPO fragment changes. TEMPOL is a TEMPO with an OH group. It is soluble in many organic solvents and forms crystals. Solutions of TEMPOL with various concentrations can be used for the reference spectroscopic measurements, as by varying the concentration the strength of inter-spin interactions between the neighboring radicals can be adjusted.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/materials/molecules.pdf}
	\caption{Chemical structures of the molecular fragments and polymers that were used for making a battery cathode containing stable nitroxide radicals.}
	\label{fig:molecules}
\end{figure}



Redox conductive conjugated polymers containing TEMPO redox groups, as pDiTBuS (poly-di-TEMPO-Butyl-Salen) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_1}, demonstrate particularly promising energy and power densities~\cite{Vereshchagin2020}. The pDiTBuS was designed as a cathode material: it is oxidized when the electrochemical cell containing this material is charged. A film of pDiTBuS comprises a high concentration of redox active stable nitroxyl radicals attached to a conjugated polymer backbone that interconnects them as a molecular wire. Such system can be viewed as a highly disordered molecular hole-transporting semiconductor (the poly-NiSalen backbone) that contains a large amount of hole traps (TEMPO groups) attached to it with butyl linkers. When the film is reduced (discharged), the TEMPO groups are in the radical state and act as unfilled traps. Upon oxidation (charging), the TEMPO fragments lose an unpaired electron and acquire a positive charge, so the traps are being filled with holes. The reversible redox reaction in the pDiTBuS film is demonstrated in a cyclic voltammogram shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}, c) and in the equal charging and discharging capacity of the film in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD_DiTBuS}, c).

\par
While active electrode materials with nitroxide radicals as redox-active groups are ideally suited for organic radical batteries (ORBs) that exhibit high power densities, the broad application of most nitroxide-based materials is limited by their moderate electrical properties. A promising route towards overcoming the conductivity problem is the use of polymers that combine radical-containing moieties and a conductive backbone. This strategy was successfully followed in a number of studies focusing on different polymers~\cite{oyaizu2015_polymerjournal, bahaceci2013_jpowersources, katsumata2006_mrc, xu2014_electact, aydin2015_jsoistatelect, schwartz2018_synthmet}. The standard redox potential of the NiSalen molecular backbone ($E_{1/2}^B$ in the middle of the peaks B and B$^\prime$ in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}) lay close to the standard redox potential of the attached nitroxide charge-bearing fragments ($E_{1/2}^A$ in the middle of the peaks A and A$^\prime$ in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}) - that ensures an efficient charge transport between the charge-bearing fragments and the conductive backbone and allows for very high charge and discharge rates up to 3000~C~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Kulikov2022}.

\subsection{PTMA}
A simple organic radical polymer containing TEMPO is poly-TEMPO-methacrylate) (PTMA, Figure~\ref{fig:molecules}~c). The polymer backbone of PTMA consists of single C-C bonds and therefore is not conductive, so the transport of charge in a PTMA film has to be mediated by adding conductive mesh such as activated carbon. When mixed with conductive carbon additive, PTMA has become a standard cathode material for ORBs and Li-ORBs, providing a discharge cell voltage of V$_{OC}=3.5$~V (with a Li anode) and a theoretical discharge capacity of $C_{theo}=111$~mAh/g~\cite{Daniel2023_Multimodal}. PTMA is soluble in acetonitrile (AN), chloroform (CF), tetrahydrofurane and dichlormethane. It is claimed to be insoluble in toluene, ethers, carbonates, and alcohols, however it becomes gel-like with some of these solvents~\cite{DOM}.

\subsection{NiSalen}
The molecular backbone of a redox conductive polymer has to conduct electric charge. A NiSalen molecule shown in Figure~\ref{fig:molecules}~d) is a Schiff complex of Ni that has a conjugated path through it. p-NiMeoSalen is polymerized NiSalen with two methoxy groups, that forms the conductive backbone of the corresponding RCPs in e) and f). The pNiSalen backbone is redox active and can store up to 2 positive charges per monomer unit~\cite{Dmitrieva2018}. The conductivity of p-NiSalen depends on its oxidation state. The oxidized polymer has higher conductivity due to a higher concentration of holes~\cite{Dmitrieva2018}. Upon oxidation of a polymeric NiSalen, the formation of positive polarons and bipolarons was observed in it with UV-Vis and EPR spectroscopy~\cite{Dmitrieva2018}, that suggests p-NiSalen is a p-type molecular semiconductor.


\subsection{Poly-Di-TEMPO-Salens}
Redox conductive conjugated polymers containing TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) redox groups, as pDiTS~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Kulikov2022} (poly-Di-Tempo-Salen) and pDiTBuS~\cite{Kulikov2023} (poly-di-TEMPO-Butyl-Salen) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:molecules} e) and f), demonstrate particularly promising energy and power densities with charging rates upto 3000~C and gravimetric capacity upto 91.5~mAh~g$^{-1}$ for pDiTS~\cite{Vereshchagin2020} (see Figure~\ref{fig:dits_ragone}) and upto 75~mAh~g$^{-1}$ for pDiTBuS~\cite{Kulikov2023}. pDiTS and pDiTBuS have similar molecular structures, except for pDiTBuS has no oxygens in the linkers that connect the backbone to the TEMPO fragments, which has led to its higher electrochemical stability and a more efficient electro-polymerization, that allows for growing thicker films. pDiTS is a charge storage material that consists of TEMPO redox active molecular fragments~\cite{Vereshchagin2022,jeschke2012_annrevphyschem,Halbmair2016} interconnected by a redox conductive conjugated NiSalen backbone~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Dmitrieva2018}. DiTS and DiTBuS monomers were synthesized in the Levin group at the Saint-Petersburg State University.\\
pDiTS was designed as a cathode material: it is oxidized when the electrochemical cell containing this material is charged. A film of pDiTBuS comprises a high concentration of redox active stable nitroxyl radicals attached to a conjugated polymer backbone that interconnects them as a molecular wire. Such system may be viewed as a highly disordered molecular hole-transporting semiconductor (the poly-NiSalen backbone) that contains a large amount of hole traps (TEMPO groups) attached to it with butyl linkers. When the film is reduced (discharged), the TEMPO groups are in the radical state and act as unfilled traps. Upon oxidation (charging), the TEMPO fragments lose an unpaired electron and acquire a positive charge, so the traps are being filled with holes~\cite{Kulikov2023}.

\end{SCfigure}

The process of polymerization is connecting multiple monomer units of one sort to a continuous molecular chain. A polymerization of redox active molecules, such as NiSalen monomer fragnents, can be done electrochemically with the setup shown in Figure~\ref{fig:electropolymerization_reaction}. A three-electrode cell is made with a 10~mM solution of NiSalen in the electrolyte. By applying a positive voltage between the WE (Au) and the CE (Pt), NiSalen molecules are adsorbed to the surface of the WE and oxidized. Oxidation of NiSalen leads to a formation of a positive radical in the ring of the NiSalen that can be seen as the opening of the ring, as shown in the diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:electropolymerization_reaction}. The oxidized, open ring attracts the next NiSalen molecule from the solution, then the positive radical is transferred from the ring to the attracted molecule through the conjugated network and the two molecules form a bond~\cite{Koshika_2009}. The reaction repeats until the conductivity of the film allows for efficient transfer of the positive radical to its outer surface. Because of charge storing ability of pNiSalen, the film growing from the oxidized monomers has to be periodically discharged to withdraw the positive charges that repel the oxidized monomers and do not allow them to attach to the film. So a pNiSalen film is grown on the WE surface~\cite{Apraksin2021,Novozhilova_2009,Vereshchagin2020}.\\ 
\par
The electrochemical polymerization of a TEMPO-Salen is done in the same way as for pNiSalen. The electrical screening effect in TEMPO-Salens is much stronger, because the oxidation potential of the charge-bearing TEMPO radicals is close to that of NiSalen and the TEMPO radicals in the film oxidize when the film is oxidized. The oxidized TEMPO radicals form a strong Coulombic ``schield'' that repells the TEMPO-Salen monomer fragments in the solution~\cite{Vereshchagin2020}. To discharge the TEMPO fragments, the growing film has to be periodically discharged, so a cycling voltage is applied to perform a cyclic polymerization of pDiTS and pDiTBuS films~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Kulikov2023}.\\

The oxidized monomers create a bond by sharing their cations. When the potential is ramped down, the holes are withdrawn from the radicals and they remain connected by forming a C-C bond instead of closing the bond in their rings.}

\section{TEMPO-Salen Films for EPR Spectroscopy}
\label{sample_fab_2}
\subsection{pDiTS Films}
The monomeric DiTS is electropolymerized to p-DiTS and simultaneously depositied onto the 12~mm$^2$ on-substrate Au WE. The setup for deposition is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_1}c. The CE for the deposition is a coiled Pt wire. Both electrodes are submerged in the electrolyte (0.1~\textsc{m} Et\textsubscript{4}NBF\textsubscript{4} in Acetonitrile (ACN)) containing 1~m\textsc{m} monomeric DiTS. The chemically inert RE for the deposition is a Ag wire in a solution of 10~m\textsc{m} AgNO\textsubscript{3} and 0.1~\textsc{m} tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate in ACN, placed inside a glass tube with a porous CoralPor\textsuperscript{TM} tip. A cyclically changing potential between $-$50~mV and $+$900~mV is applied between the CE and RE for 8 to 200 deposition cycles, at a rate upto 50~mV\,s\textsuperscript{-1}. The deposition process is monitored by recording a cyclic voltammogram (CV). This results in the deposition of a thin film of p-DiTS on the on-substrate WE. In studies involving NiMeOSalen films, 10 to 20 deposition cycles led to considerably thicker films ($\approx 1~\muup \textrm{m}$). p-DiTS has lower conductivity than p-NiMeOSalen~\cite{Vereshchagin2020}, therefore the growth of p-DiTS films is hindered after fewer deposition cycles as compared to p-NiMeOSalen. The thicknesses ($t$) of all films used in this study are listed in Appendix C\ref{Sample_info} (Sample Information). A few representative thicknesses are: for p-DiTS, 8 deposition cycles result in $t\approx\,$40~nm, and 200 deposition cycles result in $t\approx\,$500~nm films; for p-NiMeOSalen, 15 deposition cycles result in $t\approx\,$900~nm.
\par


The most electrochemically stable and pure films came from polymerized systems which were rinsed in ACN followed by propylene carbonate (PC), then rinsing the charged film (900~mV with respect to the Ag/AgNO\textsubscript{3} RE) in a beaker-based cell, and lastly potential-cycling it in the fresh electrolyte. The effects of rinsing and cycling of the polymer films in solvents/electrolyte are described in Section~\ref{sec:operando_dits}.

\subsection{pDiTBuS Films}
The pDiTBuS films for pulsed EPR experiments described in Chapter~\ref{ch:JMRO} were brought to the desired oxidation state by galvanostatic discharging with a current of 10~$\muup$A in a three-electrode electrochemical cell in a 5~ml beaker with the electrodes and the electrolyte described above.
Each potential of the film was reached by first fully charging the cell to 700~mV (vs. Ag/AgNO$_3$)and then discharging it to the desired potential (labeled points in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S3}). When the desired potential was \ik{reached}, the output relay of the potentiostat was opened so that no current went through the cell after charging. The substrate with the WE and the pDiTBuS film was removed from the charging cell, placed in a 5~mm OD quartz EPR tube, evacuated down to $<5\times10^{-3}$~mbar, filled with He up to a pressure of 500--600 mbar, then flame sealed with a H$_2$/O$_2$ burner.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\caption{Initial galvanostatic discharge curve for the pDiTBuS film with the redox potentials described in the main text.

The SoC values corresponding to the initial (individual) discharge curve are a): SoC~98~(98)\%, b): SoC~\ik{94~(96)}\%, c): SoC~57(65)\%, d): SoC~0(0)\%. (Dis-) charging current: 10~$\muup$A, charging rate: 6.25~C. After this initial discharging, the pDiTBuS film has undergone 10 charge-discharge cycles and 4 temperature cycles.}

	\label{fig:Figure_S27}
\end{figure}

\ik{
After reaching the fully charged state with 10~$\muup$A (by $t=0$ in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}), a 10~$\muup$A discharge current was applied to reach the four states of charge considered in this study (a-d in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27} and in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S3}). Initially, the full charging capacity of the film was 1.48~$\muup$Ah$~=5.11$~\ik{m}C (3.29e+16 electrons withdrawn upon the full charging). The charging capacity had decreased by 0.06~$\muup$Ah ($4\%$) after the four temperature cycles between 300~K and 5~K during the cryogenic EPR measurements.\\
}

\ik{
From the quantitative analysis of the GCD for each SoC, one calculates the number of elementary charges that are transferred to the film (withdrawn from the film) upon charging (discharging). The GCD and the calculated values of the transferred charge are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}. During the full discharge from +700~mV down to -200~mV the pDiTBuS film has gained a total charge of 1.355~$\muup$Ah=4.88~\ik{m}C (d), corresponding to 3.01e+16 electrons that had been transferred to the film.)
}
\ik{ 
The considered SoC correspond to discharging by $0.020\pm0.005~\muup$Ah (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}~a, $(5\pm1)\times10^{14}$ electrons injected), $0.060\pm0.005~\muup$Ah (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}~b, $(1.4\pm0.1)\times10^{15}$ electrons injected), $0.480\pm0.005~\muup$Ah (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}~c, $(1.07\pm0.01)\times10^{16}$ electrons injected) and $1.360\pm0.005~\muup$Ah (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}~d, $(3.05\pm0.01)\times10^{16}$~electrons injected). The SoC values determined from the respective potentials are different when mapped to the initial discharge curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_S3} and when considering the individual discharge curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}, as the film was gradually losing its capacity during the temperature cycling, so the discharge curves were reaching the considered potentials at shorter times, leading to a lower Coulomb counting, lower discharge capacity and therefore a lower SoC.}




\section{Electrochemical Cells for Operando EPR spectroscopy}
\label{sec:operando_cell_fab}
One significant drawback with spectroelectrochemical EPR spectroscopy is the fact that microwave resonators suffer from substantial microwave damping as a result of introducing metal electrodes, polar solvents and ionic salts (i.e., the electrolyte) needed for successful electrochemistry.\cite{Chatgilialoglu2012}. Microwave damping can be significantly reduced by using an on-substrate electrode design (see Fig.~\ref{fig:flat_tube}) as this limits the amount of metal that is introduced into the resonator, while still allowing for electrode surface areas large enough to deposit sufficient material of interest to observe EPR signals.


\newpage
\subsection{Cells Based on a Modified EPR Sample Tube}
\label{sec:tube_cell}
\label{electrode_setup}

An electrochemical half-cell shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_1} was constructed inside an X band EPR sample tube. The WE of the cell was electrochemically polymerized on a flat Au electrode formed on a 3.5~mm wide quartz substrate. The second on-substrate Au electrode was used as the CE. The substrate was inserted inside the EPR sample tube. The tip of the tube was flattened to reduce the amount of electrolyte in the half-cell.\\
\par
The on-substrate electrodes are produced as follows. Cleaned quartz substrates are placed inside a holder and covered with shadow masks. The assembly is transferred into a vacuum chamber equipped with a thermal evaporator (MBraun ProVap 5G PVD System). At a pressure of $7\times10^{-7}$~mbar, 10~nm of Chromium (Cr) adhesion layer is evaporated, followed by 180~nm of Gold (Au). In this way the on-substrate working and counter electrodes are formed (WE and CE respectively). The reference electrode (RE) is not evaporated on substrate for electrochemical stability reasons. Instead, a \SI{250}{\micro\meter} Ag wire is used, either as is or, for additional stability, coated galvanically with a AgCl layer~\cite{Safari2011}. See Section~\ref{sec:re_prep} for details of the preparation of the reference electrode.\\
\par
The above procedure provides a WE active area of 12.0~mm$^2$ which allows one to deposit an electrochemically active film that is large enough to yield a clear EPR signal. The flat electrode design provides the possibility to increase the WE area for samples with particularly small EPR signals while still maintaining certain film thicknesses. This also allows for studying EPR properties as a function of film thickness. In cases where the electrochemical process is thought to deposit material on both the WE and CE, the distance between the on-substrate electrodes can be adjusted such that only one of the electrodes is positioned in the active volume of the microwave resonator, allowing for selective EPR probing of either of the electrodes.\\
\par
The on-substrate electrodes reduce microwave damping. However, a substantial amount of microwave damping occurs due to the electrolyte, made of polar solvent and ionic salts. Therefore, the spectroelectrochemical setup was optimized by modifying conventional 5~mm outer diameter (OD) quartz EPR tubes by flattening the bottom 1.3$-$1.6~cm (cf.\ Figure~\ref{fig:flat_tube}b and Section~\ref{sec:flat_tube_fab}), thereby reducing the active electrolyte volume needed to submerge both the WE and CE on the substrate as well as the RE wire. By using the flattened tube, the volume of the electrolyte was reduced from $V\sim$120~$\muup$l to $V<70~\muup$l.


\newpage
\begin{figure}[H]

 \label{fig:flat_tube}
\end{figure}

\par
The flattened tube and the thin-film electrode setup have an additional benefit in that the sample is moved away from the maximum of the electric field distribution in the Bruker ER~4122-SHQE resonator (TE\textsubscript{011} mode cavity for cwEPR), thereby further increasing the resonator $Q$ factor and hence sensitivity. Further improvements can be made using the flat electrode setup in a TM\textsubscript{110} mode cwEPR cylindrical cavity such as a Bruker ER~4103-TM (developed for studying samples exhibiting high dielectric constants), where the flattened cell can be aligned to further reduce coupling to the microwave electric field. The modified tube is compatible with commercial Bruker ER~4118X-MD5 resonators, most commonly used for advanced pulse EPR measurements at X-band frequencies ($\nu = 9-10$~GHz).\\

\par
There are some differences in the CV recorded in a beaker (setup schematic in Fig.~\ref{fig:flat_tube}c) as compared to the CV measured in the modified tube (setup schematic in Fig.~\ref{fig:flat_tube}d). As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:flat_tube}e, the CV measured in the modified tube (blue curve) shows slightly shifted and broader oxidation and reduction peaks as compared to the in-beaker measurements (solid-brown and and crossed-black curves) for the same p-DiTS film. The shift is mainly due to the use of different reference electrodes, while we attribute the broader peaks to the smaller electrolyte volume used in the modified tube. The electrolyte volume seen by the on-substrate films in the modified tube is significantly smaller than the total electrolyte volume of 60 -- 70~$\muup$L, as only 0.35~mm of space remains between the inner width of the flattened modified tube and the substrate. Hence, not more than a 0.2~mm layer of electrolyte is seen by the films. The CV in a modified tube shows less distortions with slower scan rates (e.g. 5~mV\,s\textsuperscript{-1} used for studies in Section~\ref{Degradation_study}) and also with higher concentrations of the electrolyte, as the former gives more time for the ion diffusion and the latter improves the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. While the CV in the modified tube is distorted, the oxidation and reduction peaks remain symmetric, suggesting that the reversibility of the redox process is not hindered.



\subsection{Modification of the Sample Tube}
\label{sec:flat_tube_fab}
The volume of the cell used in this study had to be minimized, as the high dielectric constant of the electrolyte does not allow for the critical coupling of the resonator. The volume of the electrolyte was minimized by flattening the tip of the quartz (melting point $T_m=1660-1710\,^{\circ}$C) tube accommodating the cell. For that, a tungsten (W, $T_m=3420\,^{\circ}$C) rod of a 3.70$\times$1.35$\,$mm rectangular cross section, narrowing to the bottom of the tube at a wedge angle of $\alpha \approx 5 ^{\circ}$, was inserted into the tube (Fig.~\ref{fig:S1_modified_tube}). The tube was evacuated and filled with He to a pressure of 100~mbar. The tip of the evacuated tube was molten around the thermally expanded rod with a Hydrogen-Oxygen burner ($T_f = 3080\,^{\circ}$C). The modified tube was then connected to atmosphere and the cooled, contracted rod was removed and later reused for modifying other tubes. The tungsten rod was fabricated from an electrode of a flash lamp of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./operando_epr/figures/spins_at_work/Figure_S1.pdf}
\caption{Modifying the tip of the standard 5~mm OD quartz EPR sample tube by melting it around a Tungsten (W) forming rod with a H$_2$/O$_2$ burner in an evacuation setup.}
\label{fig:S1_modified_tube}
\end{figure}

The modification of the tip of the tube provided a decrease in the volume of the electrolyte down to \SI{45}{\micro\liter}, while the cylindrical part of the tube allowed for fitting the substrate connector and the wiring in. That allowed for the room temperature EPR measurements on the electrochemical cell during charging and discharging. Extensive care had to be taken to reproduce the cv curve in the modified tube as the limited volume of the electrolyte was distributed over the large surface area. That caused poor ionic transport in the electrolyte layer.\\


To establish the extent to which the modified tube improves the resonator Q-factor (Q) and therefore sensitivity of the cwEPR experiment, cwEPR spectra and associated Q-factors were recorded for a flat-electrode p-DiTS cell assembled in two different sample tubes. For both cell setups we used enough electrolyte to submerge all three electrodes. This required 100~$\muup$l for the standard tube and 70~$\muup$l for the modified tube. The effect of the two tubes on the cwEPR spectrum and on the Q-factor was studied for a range of heights ($H$) measured from the center of the microwave resonator to the middle of the WE.

\begin{SCfigure}%[h]

\label{fig:Q_factors_mod_tube}
\end{SCfigure}


%\subsection{Q-factors and cwEPR spectra for p-DiTS in standard and modified tube}\label{Q-factor_SNR}
\subsection{Enhanced Performance of the Modified Sample Tube}\label{Q-factor_SNR}

The empty Bruker ER~4122-SHQE resonator has a Q~$\approx$~7800. Inserting the tube-based cells initially at $H=$~24~mm reduces the Q-factor for both cases, but more significantly for the standard tube (Q\textsubscript{standard tube}~$\approx$~4200, Q\textsubscript{modified tube}~$\approx$~5400, see Fig.~\ref{fig:Q_factors_mod_tube}). At $H=$~18~mm the Q-factor drops for both, again more significantly for the standard tube to Q\textsubscript{standard tube}~$\approx$~300 while for the modified tube it is still Q\textsubscript{modified tube}~$\approx$~1200, a factor of 4 difference. This difference between the two tubes shows the benefit of using the modified tube and flat electrode geometries for SEC EPR. When the modified tube is inserted as deep as $H=$~14~mm, the Q\textsubscript{modified tube} is around 400, which still allows for EPR measurements. Coupling the resonator not possible for $H<18$~mm (standard tube) and $H<14$~mm (modified tube).

\par
The decreasing Q-factor is not the only effect of a high-dielectric sample in an EPR resonator. The interaction between the sample and the electric field distribution of the resonator causes a mixture of absorption and dispersion signals, leading to asymmetric lineshapes in the cwEPR spectra. This makes double integration of the derivative cwEPR signal more complex, thereby making a quantitative analysis more difficult. This effect can be seen in the cwEPR spectra of a p-DiTS electrochemical cell with liquid electrolyte (Fig.~\ref{fig:Q_factors_mod_tube}) measured in the standard 5~mm tube for $H=$~18~mm where the cwEPR signal is asymmetric. The modified tube yields symmetric lineshapes at the same sample heights.

\par

The electrochemical cells based on the modified tube allow for higher EPR signals as compared to the normal X-band EPR tube. Fig.~\ref{fig:S2_Qfactor} represents two sets of measurements that describe the enhancement of the EPR signal for the modified tube. When the cell is inserted closer to the resonator's center, the Q factor of the resonator lowers and the EPR signal increases, because the intensity of the magnetic component of the microwave field B$_1$ is higher in the center of the resonator. When the cells were inserted closer to the center of the resonator, the Q factor went from $\approx$~6000 down to $\approx$~400, so that the microwave bridge could not be critically coupled to the resonator and no EPR measurements were possible. Depending on the volume of the electrolyte in the cell, it can be inserted more or less deep into the resonator.

The modified tube could be inserted 7 mm deeper into the microwave resonator (see Fig.~\ref{fig:S2_Qfactor}). The EPR signal in the modified tube is increased as compared to the normal tube at the same height.

\begin{figure*}[h]

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./operando_epr/figures/spins_at_work/Figure_S2.pdf}

\label{fig:S2_Qfactor}
\end{figure*}

\par
The modified tube also allows for larger cwEPR signal intensities as it can be inserted closer to the resonator center. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for the modified tube is increased by a factor of $\approx$6 as compared to the standard tube, both inserted at $H=$18~mm. At the maximum sample insertion, the S/N is improved by a factor of $\approx$8 for the modified tube.
\par
Using the modified tube brings three major benefits. Firstly, it results in much higher Q-factors and therefore sensitivity when comparing Q-factors for the same sample height. Secondly, the modified tube allows for insertion of the tube closer to the resonator center, allowing for a larger S/N and therefore requiring less averaging time for each cwEPR measurement. This is especially useful for samples where holding the potential for long periods causes unwanted effects or degradation. Thirdly, cwEPR measurements with the modified tube give symmetric cwEPR lineshapes (using the conventional procedure for critically coupling the microwave cavity, the standard tube gives an asymmetric lineshape) which allows for more straightforward quantitative analysis (spin counting), especially useful for in-situ cwEPR with varying redox potentials.






\subsection{Reference Electrode}
\label{sec:re_prep}
The Ag/AgCl reference (RE) electrode for the EPR-compatible electrochemical cells described in Section~\ref{sec:tube_cell} was formed by coating a layer of AgCl onto a 250~$\muup$m Ag wire galvanically from a 1~\textsc{m} aqueous solution of KCl. For that, the Ag wire and a Pt wire were connected as a cathode and an anode respectively to 10$\,$mL of the KCL solution and a DC potential of 500$\,$mV was applied for 7500$\,$s which resulted in a dark AgCl layer deposited onto the Ag cathode. In the beginning of the galvanic deposition, the current through the KCl solution was changing in a jumpy manner, that indicated the growth of the AgCl layer. The galvanic process was stopped after the current was stable for at least 300$\,$s.\\

\end{figure}


The cells based on the modified sample tube, although containing less electrolyte, were shown to quickly lose their electrochemical performance due to irreversible processes in the electrolyte accelerated by the microwave heating  (see Section~\ref{Degradation_study}). In order to further improve the electrochemical performance of the DUT while maintaining its spectroscopic properties, a two-electrode setup with a separator shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sandwich_assembly} was developed. Two planar 2.7~mm wide polished quartz substrates were covered with a 7~nm layer of Cr and a 180~nm layer of Au. One substrates was covered with a redox active pDiTBuS film and used as a RE. The other substrate was either covered with pNiSalen (full cell), or was used as is (half cell) as a CE. A 0.1~mm polypropylene film was sandwiched between the two substrates to prevent a shortcut from WE to CE and fixed with Parafilm$^{TM}$. The cell was submerged into a concentrated electrolyte solution ($10~$mM Et$_4$NBF$_4$ in ACN), tested electrochemically and sealed with Parafilm$^{TM}$. The cell preparation is shown in a scheme in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD_DiTBuS}. The two-electrode cell with a separator was inserted into the standard 5~mm OD EPR sample tube. The cells with the separator allowed for longer spectroelectrochemical measurements, including operando low-temperature measurements close to the freezing point of the electrolyte, shown in Section~\ref{sec:all_polymer}. The discharge capacity of the DUT (see Figure~\ref{fig:transistor_battery_GCD}) is much lower than that of the tube-based cells, the potential to reach the desired charge state is drifting with time, but the DUT still benefits from the reduced volume of the electrolyte which reduces microwave-induced degradation effects.

The electrolyte based on an ionic liquid incorporated in a gel polymer matrix has sufficient ionic mobility and diffusion to penetrate the pDiTBuS and pNiSalen surface and allow for partial charging and discharging of the battery electrodes. TEMPO radicals were shown to undergo a redox reaction in ionic liquids, although with a slightly changed redox potential of the TEMPO$^{\bullet}$-TEMPO$^+$ reaction~\cite{Golovisnina2023}. The ionic mobility of the polymer-based electrolyte is much less than that for the liquid electrolyte so the cell electrodes have to be placed close to each other in order to provide sufficient charging current. A set of micro-structured interdigitated electrodes shown in Figure~\ref{fig:transistor_battery_assewmbly} was used to produce a pDiTBuS cell with the polymer electrolyte. The two sets of electrodes were etched on a quartz substrate with photo-lithography in a topology shown in Figure~\ref{fig:transistor_battery_assewmbly}~a). The distance between the electrodes was 5~$\muup$m for one batch and 10~$\muup$m for another batch.\\

In order to deposit the electrode material on the on-substrate cathodes without affecting the on-substrate anodes, closely positioned to the cathodes, the anodes were biased during the electro-deposition. The setup for separate electrode deposition is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:transistor_battery_deposition}. Without biasing the inactive set of the on-substrate electrodes, the polymer was deposited on both sets of electrodes because of the strong electric field induced at the edges of the active electrodes that, over the 5~$\muup$m distance was inducing a potential on the inactive electrodes high enough to cause the polymerization reaction. The distribution of the electric current in the inter-digitated setup is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:grid_current_density_sumulation}. A conformal transformation was done in order to simplify the calculation to two dimensions, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:grid_current_density_sumulation}~a). These all-polymer batteries, although with a moderate electrochemical performance (see Figure~\ref{fig:transistor_battery_GCD}) were used in the operando cwEPR measurements presented in Section~\ref{sec:all_polymer} as more stable DUTs. The batteries based on interdigitated grids with the polymer electrolyte can be used, for example, for electrically-detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\\

\subsection{Demountable Electrochemical Cell for pEPR Spectroscopy}
\label{fab:ex_situ_charging}



PDiTBuS was grown as a thin film on an on-substrate flat 3$\times$4~mm$^2$ Au working electrode (WE) of a three-electrode cell as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_1}d, by means of electrochemical polymerization. The on-substrate electrodes described in Section~\ref{sec:operando_cell_fab} were used. The electrochemical polymerization with 50 electropolymerization cycles yielded a pDiTBuS film with a capacity of 1.6~$\muup$Ah with an estimated mass of 20$-$30~$\muup$g and thickness of 800$-$1000~nm \ik{(see Appendix~C for calculations)}\\

The pDiTBuS film was brought to a desired charge state with the electrochemical setup shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_1}d. The container was filled with pure electrolyte (without DiTBuS monomers) and a static current of \q{$\pm10$}~$\muup$A was applied between WE and CE for lifting or lowering the electric potential of the film. The potential of the film during charging and discharging was recorded with respect to the RE as the Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) curve (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_1} and Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S3}). When the GCD reached a desired potential, the WE was disconnected from the current source and the substrate with the pDiTBuS film was removed from the cell. The substrate was dried in pre-vacuum and flame sealed in a 5~mm OD quartz tube under 500~mbar of He. The tube was then  frozen in liquid N$_2$ (77~K) and transported to the pre-cooled EPR spectrometer. In order to alter the \ik{SoC} of the film between the EPR measurements, the tube was gradually warmed up to room temperature and opened, then the substrate \ik{with the charged film} was removed from the tube and placed to the electrochemical setup where it was fully \ik{charged from the preserved SoC} to 700~mV, and discharged to the \ik{next} desired SoC galvanostatically (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}). After charging, the substrate was dried and encapsulated as described. SoC corresponding to -200~mV, 430~mV, 500~mV and 590~mV vs. the RE were considered. The potentials correspond to 0\%, 65\%, 95\% and 98\% of the full \ik{1.4}~$\muup$Ah \ik{discharging} capacity of the film, determined with Coulomb counting~\cite{Movassagh2021}. (\ik{The charging capacity of the film has decreased by 12\% upon repeated charging and temperature cycling,} cf. Section~\ref{sample_fab_2}).\\

\section{Energy Diagram of an Electrochemical Half-Cell}
The transfer of charges in a TEMPO-Salen electrochemical cell can be described in an energy diagram shown in Figure~\ref{fig:band_diagram}. The energy scale of the diagram starts at the vacuum level - the energy of a free electron. The potential energy of an electron in the Au lead in this energy scale is the work function of Au which is 5.1~eV~\cite{Eastman1970}.  
The energy at which an electron in a material can be found with a 0.5 probability is called the Fermi energy.
The Fermi energy of a cathode changes with the SoC of the cell.

The redox potential of TEMPO is 0.812~V vs. SHE~\cite{Zhou2020}.
The absolute potential of the SHE is 4.44~V vs the vacuum level.
The workfunction of Au is 5.1 eV.
The electrochemical window of Acetonitrile is between -3.45~V and +2.35~V vs. SCE (+0.268 V vs SHE)~\cite{Luca2015}.

Electrochemical doping of a semicouducting polymer~\cite{Jacobs2022}:
Charge transfer, ion insertion.
The oxidation and reduction potentials of the ions are separated from the redox potentials of the polymer by several volts, so no charge transfer occurs between the polymer and the electrolyte. The positive charge injected to the polymer from the metal is compensated by the intercalated negative ion. The ionization efficiency in electrochemically doped films is close to 100\%~\cite{Jacobs2022}.\\

During the charging of a poly-TEMPO-Salen half-cell, its electrochemically active cathode film is being oxidized: positive charges are being injected into it. If the bias potential of the cathode $E$ is higher than the oxidation potential of the polymer (see Figure~\ref{fig:band_diagram}~a)), a positive charge charge is injected to the pNiSalen backbone. The oxidation potential of pNiSalen was adjusted during the molecular synthesis to be close to the oxidation potential of TEMPO$^{\bullet}$, so that the oxidation of the backbone would lead to a simultaneous oxidation of the charge bearing groups~\cite{Vereshchagin2020}. If $E$ increases above the oxidation potential of TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ and the polymer backbone connecting the metal and the TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ fragment is oxidized, the injected hole reaches the TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ fragment and oxidizes it to TEMPO$^+$. The charge transfer process during the charging of the half-cell is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:band_diagram}~a). The oxidation TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ leads to a creation of an electric double layer next to the cathode~\cite{Bhojane2022} of a negative BF4${^-}$ ion is attracted from the electrolyte solution to the positively charged backbone.\\

The hole injected into the polymer backbone propagates in the direction of the Fermi energy gradient within the biased polymer until it encounters the unpaired electron on a TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ group and recombines with it. During the recombination, the hole disappears from the backbone and the electron disappears from the TEMPO$^{\bullet}$. The charge bearing group oxidizes to TEMPO$^+$. This process can be seen as the hole hopping from the backbone to the TEMPO radical. The TEMPO radicals therefore serve as hole traps.\\

The consequent oxidation of the redox active groups during the biasing of the polymer cathode is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:biasing_charging}.
