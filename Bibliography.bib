   abstract = {Lithium metal is a promising anode material for Li-ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low potential. The growth of dendrites is a major barrier to the development of high capacity, rechargeable Li batteries with lithium metal anodes, and hence, significant efforts have been undertaken to develop new electrolytes and separator materials that can prevent this process or promote smooth deposits at the anode. Central to these goals, and to the task of understanding the conditions that initiate and propagate dendrite growth, is the development of analytical and nondestructive techniques that can be applied in situ to functioning batteries. MRI has recently been demonstrated to provide noninvasive imaging methodology that can detect and localize microstructure buildup. However, until now, monitoring dendrite growth by MRI has been limited to observing the relatively insensitive metal nucleus directly, thus restricting the temporal and spatial resolution and requiring special hardware and acquisition modes. Here, we present an alternative approach to detect a broad class of metallic dendrite growth via the dendrites' indirect effects on the surrounding electrolyte, allowing for the application of fast 3D1 H MRI experiments with high resolution. We use these experiments to reconstruct 3D images of growing Li dendrites from MRI, revealing details about the growth rate and fractal behavior. Radiofrequency and static magnetic field calculations are used alongside the images to quantify the amount of the growing structures.},

Thus there results a component of the nuclear polarization at right angles to both the constant and the r-f field and it is shown that under normal laboratory conditions this component can induce observable voltages.

   abstract = {We report the development of in situ (online) EPR and coupled EPR/NMR methods to study redox flow batteries, which are applied here to investigate the redox-active electrolyte, 2,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ). The radical anion, DHAQ3-·, formed as a reaction intermediate during the reduction of DHAQ2-, was detected and its concentration quantified during electrochemical cycling. The fraction of the radical anions was found to be concentration-dependent, the fraction decreasing as the total concentration of DHAQ increases, which we interpret in terms of a competing dimer formation mechanism. Coupling the two techniques - EPR and NMR - enables the rate constant for the electron transfer between DHAQ3-· and DHAQ4- anions to be determined. We quantify the concentration changes of DHAQ during the "high-voltage"hold by NMR spectroscopy and correlate it quantitatively to the capacity fade of the battery. The decomposition products, 2,6-dihydroxyanthrone and 2,6-dihydroxyanthranol, were identified during this hold; they were shown to undergo subsequent irreversible electrochemical oxidation reaction at 0.7 V, so that they no longer participate in the subsequent electrochemistry of the battery when operated in the standard voltage window of the cell. The decomposition reaction rate was found to be concentration-dependent, with a faster rate being observed at higher concentrations. Taking advantage of the inherent flow properties of the system, this work demonstrates the possibility of multi-modal in situ (online) characterizations of redox flow batteries, the characterization techniques being applicable to a range of electrochemical flow systems.},

The scientific community is trying to work together to solve this problem, and one of the strategies is to use pseudocapacitive materials, which take advantage of reversible surface or near-surface Faradaic processes to store charge. It enables pseudocapacitors to transcend the capacity and mass transfer limitations of electrical double-layer capacitors and batteries. The study of pseudocapacitance, as well as materials that exhibit this behavior, has advanced dramatically during the last decade. The contribution of this study is to look at the history of the idea of pseudocapacitance and how it became popular in electrochemical energy storage, as well as to explain new families of materials with pseudocapacitive electrochemical energy storage behavior. The advanced next-generation electrode materials are expected to deliver high energy density without compromising it with the power density aspects. This review seeks to provide a complete overview of electrochemical energy storage in terms of its foundations, technological applications, recent advances, and the outlook of various transition metal-based electrode materials for energy storage applications. This review suggests that the current problem with the energy storage systems and how to solve them like diffusion kinetics, fast ionic transport, rate-capability, high-rate performance, peeling of the materials, enhancing the electronic conductivity, etc. by providing the recent re-engineering approach of novel next-generation electrode materials, their material designing strategies like nanostructurization, atomic-level engineering using creating the defect structures, interlayer tuning of the nanostructures. These are some approaches to enhance and explore the new charge storage phenomenon.

However, molecular doping carries with it several intrinsic problems stemming directly from the redox-active character of these materials. A recent breakthrough was a doping technique based on ion-exchange, which separates the redox and charge compensation steps of the doping process. Here, the equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange doping in a model system, poly(2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno(3,2-b)thiophene) (PBTTT) doped with FeCl3 and an ionic liquid, is studied, reaching conductivities in excess of 1000 S cm−1 and ion exchange efficiencies above 99%. Several factors that enable such high performance, including the choice of acetonitrile as the doping solvent, which largely eliminates electrolyte association effects and dramatically increases the doping strength of FeCl3, are demonstrated. In this high ion exchange efficiency regime, a simple connection between electrochemical doping and ion exchange is illustrated, and it is shown that the performance and stability of highly doped PBTTT is ultimately limited by intrinsically poor stability at high redox potential.},

Increasingly more researchers are focusing on harvesting and converting solar energy, mechanical vibration, waste heat, and wind to electricity. Electrical energy storage technologies play a significant role in the demand for green and sustainable energy. Rechargeable batteries or secondary batteries, such as Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries, and Mg-ion batteries, reversibly convert between electrical and chemical energy via redox reactions, thus storing the energy as chemical potential in their electrodes. The energy density of a rechargeable battery is determined collectively by the specific capacity of electrodes and the working voltage of the cell, which is the differential potential between the cathode and the anode. Over the past decades, a significant number of studies have focused on enhancing this specific capacity; however, studies to understand and manipulate the electrochemical potential of the electrode materials are limited. In this review, the material characteristics that determine and influence the electrochemical potentials of electrodes are discussed. In particular, the cathode materials that convert electricity and chemical potential through electrochemical intercalation reactions are investigated. In addition, we summarize the selection criteria for elements or compounds and the effect of the local atomic environment on the discharge potential, including the effects of site energy, defects, crystallinity, and microstructure, using LiMn2O4, V2O5, Mo6S8, LiFePO4, and LiCoO2 as model samples for discussion.},

   abstract = {R echargeable Li-ion cells are key components of the portable, entertainment, computing and telecommunication equipment required by today's information-rich, mobile society. Despite the impressive growth in sales of batteries worldwide, the science underlying battery technology is often criticized for its slow advancement. This is true whatever the technology considered (for example, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride or Li ion). Certainly, when compared, energy storage cannot keep pace with the rate of progress in the computer industry (Moore's law predicts a doubling of memory capacity every two years), yet the past decade has produced spectacular advances in chemistry and engineering within the emerging technologies of Ni-MeH and Li-ion batteries. These cells are now supplanting the well known Ni-Cd batteries. A battery is composed of several electrochemical cells that are connected in series and/or in parallel to provide the required voltage and capacity, respectively. Each cell consists of a positive and a negative electrode (both sources of chemical reactions) separated by an electrolyte solution containing dissociated salts, which enable ion transfer between the two electrodes. Once these electrodes are connected externally, the chemical reactions proceed in tandem at both electrodes, thereby liberating electrons and enabling the current to be tapped by the user. The amount of electrical energy, expressed either per unit of weight (W h kg-1) or per unit of volume (W h l-1), that a battery is able to deliver is a function of the cell potential (V) and capacity (A h kg-1), both of which are linked directly to the chemistry of the system. Among the various existing technologies (Fig. 1), Li-based batteries-because of their high energy density and design flexibility-currently outperform other systems , accounting for 63% of worldwide sales values in portable batteries 1. This explains why they receive most attention at both fundamental and applied levels. Historical developments in Li-battery research Before reviewing the present status of research and future challenges for Li-battery technologies, we present a brief historical account of developments over the past 30 years, as personally perceived. The motivation for using a battery technology based on Li metal as anode relied initially on the fact that Li is the most electropositive (-3.04 V versus standard hydrogen electrode) as well as the lightest (equivalent weight M6.94 g mol-1 , and specific gravity 0.53 g cm-3) metal, thus facilitating the design of storage systems with high energy density. The advantage in using Li metal was first demonstrated in the 1970s with the assembly of primary (for example, non-rechargeable) Li cells 2. Owing to their high capacity and variable discharge rate, they rapidly found applications as power sources for watches, calculators or for implantable medical devices. Over the same period, numerous inorganic compounds were shown to react with alkali metals in a reversible way. The discovery of such materials, which were later identified as intercalation compounds, was crucial in the development of high-energy rechargeable Li systems. Like most innovations, development of the technology resulted from several contributions. By 1972, the concept of electro-chemical intercalation and its potential use were clearly defined 3,4 , although the information was not widely disseminated , being reported only in conference proceedings. Technological improvements in rechargeable solid-state batteries are being driven by an ever-increasing demand for portable electronic devices. Lithium-ion batteries are the systems of choice, offering high energy density, flexible and lightweight design, and longer lifespan than comparable battery technologies. We present a brief historical review of the development of lithium-based rechargeable batteries, highlight ongoing research strategies, and discuss the challenges that remain regarding the synthesis, characterization, electrochemical performance and safety of these systems 300 200 100 0 Energy density (W h l-1) 0 50 100 150 Energy density (W h kg-1) 400 Lighter weight Lead-acid 200 250 Ni-Cd Ni-MH Li ion Li metal ('unsafe') PLiON Smaller size Figure 1 Comparison of the different battery technologies in terms of volumetric and gravimetric energy density. The share of worldwide sales for Ni-Cd, Ni-MeH and Li-ion portable batteries is 23, 14 and 63%, respectively. The use of Pb-acid batteries is restricted mainly to SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) in automobiles or standby applications, whereas Ni-Cd batteries remain the most suitable technologies for high-power applications (for example, power tools).},

Electron transport and charge storage must be accompanied by ion transport and doping for charge neutrality, but the nature of this process in organic radical polymers is not well understood. This is difficult to intuitively predict because the pendant radical group distinguishes organic radical polymers from conjugated, charged or polar polymers. Here we show for the first time a quantitative view of in situ ion transport and doping in organic radical polymers during the redox process. Two modes dominate: doping by lithium ion expulsion and doping by anion uptake. The dominance of one mode over the other is controlled by anion type, electrolyte concentration and timescale. These results apply in any scenario in which electrolyte is in contact with a non-conjugated redox active polymer and present a means of quantifying doping effects.},

In particular, the concept of an active site is explained and the role of these sites in bonding mechanisms is illustrated. The model is then verified in laboratory using experimental and theoretical techniques appropriate for the problem posed. Electrochemistry in organic environment is used to impart to the surfaces a homogeneous acid or basic character (i.e. electron acceptor or donor) and to set up an intense anisotropic electrical field allowing nonrandom simulation of the fields induced by the roughness of the potential of the surface of an industrial object. It is thus demonstrated that the establishment of a strong metal—polymer bond results from so‐called Lewis acid—base reactions activated by the interfacial electrical field. Finally, the ageing study of the metal—polymer system thus obtained shows that the interface is stable relative to atmospheric oxygen and that vacuum pyrolysis converts the polymer into a carbon fibre strongly bonded to the metal.

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

   abstract = {Printed electronics is a revolutionary technology aimed at unconventional electronic device manufacture on plastic foils, and will probably rely on polymeric semiconductors for organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) fabrication. In addition to having excellent charge-transport characteristics in ambient conditions, such materials must meet other key requirements, such as chemical stability, large solubility in common solvents, and inexpensive solution and/or low-temperature processing. Furthermore, compatibility of both p-channel (hole-transporting) and n-channel (electron-transporting) semiconductors with a single combination of gate dielectric and contact materials is highly desirable to enable powerful complementary circuit technologies, where p- and n-channel OTFTs operate in concert. Polymeric complementary circuits operating in ambient conditions are currently difficult to realize: although excellent p-channel polymers are widely available, the achievement of high-performance n-channel polymers is more challenging. Here we report a highly soluble (∼60 g l -1) and printable n-channel polymer exhibiting unprecedented OTFT characteristics (electron mobilities up to ∼0.45-0.85 cm2 V -1 s-1) under ambient conditions in combination with Au contacts and various polymeric dielectrics. Several top-gate OTFTs on plastic substrates were fabricated with the semiconductor-dielectric layers deposited by spin-coating as well as by gravure, flexographic and inkjet printing, demonstrating great processing versatility. Finally, all-printed polymeric complementary inverters (with gain 25-65) have been demonstrated. ©2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

The compounds are characterized by very small effective masses and modest electron-phonon couplings for both holes and electrons. The hole and electron transport characteristics are found to be very similar along the stacking directions; for example, in the DMQtT-F 4TCNQ crystal, the hole and electron effective masses are as small as 0.20 and 0.26 m 0, respectively. This similarity arises from the fact that the electronic couplings of both hole and electron are controlled by the same superexchange mechanism. Remarkable ambipolar charge-transport properties are predicted for all three crystals. Our calculations thus provide strong indications that mixed-stack donor-acceptor materials represent a class of systems with high potential in organic electronics. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

With the significant progress of the discovery of novel organic molecules and the further improvements of device fabrication technology, some organic molecules can break the limit of our knowledge and show very high mobilities. In this review, organic polymers and small molecules with mobilities above 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 are first introduced to provide the readers with a general understanding of the features and characteristics of high-performance organic semiconductors. Then, some important parameters, including the molecular structures, the device configurations, and the performance, are discussed in detail.

The results demonstrate that the as-synthesized nitroxide radical polymers showed an electrochemically reversible redox reaction of the TEMPO radicals at 3.5 V vs Li/Li+. When used as cathode material in galvanostatic cycling tests, P1 exhibited a moderate initial specific capacity of 47 mA h g−1 (62% of the theoretical capacity) which slowly fades to 38 mA h g−1 within 50 cycles.},

Then the homopolymers of 4-(3-(Pyrrol-1-yl)butyryloxy)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yloxy (PPy-B-TEMPO) and 4-(3-(Pyrrol-1-yl)hexanoyloxy)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yloxy (PPy-C-TEMPO) were prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization. The structure, morphology, electrochemical properties of prepared polymers were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammograms (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), respectively. Also, the charge-discharge properties of the prepared polymers were studied by galvanostatic charge-discharge testing. The results demonstrated that the as-synthesized nitroxide radical polymers showed a reversible two-electron redox reaction process in the potential limits of 2.5-3.0 V and 3.4-3.8 V vs Li/Li+, respectively. Under our experimental conditions, PPy only presented the discharge capacity of 16.5 mAh·g-1 at 20 mA·g-1 between 2.5 and 4.2 V, while PPy-B-TEMPO with the short side-chain linked to TEMPO groups exhibited an initial discharge capacity of up to 86.5 mAh·g-1 with two well-dened plateaus. Furthermore, the PPy-C-TEMPO with the longer linking side-chain even displayed a discharge capacity of 115 mAh·g-1. These superior electrochemical performances were ascribed to the flexible linking side-chain and the introduction of stable conductive PPy main chain, which benefits the improvement of charge carrier transportation in the aggregated polymer bulk. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using CWX-band EPR we can follow the film formation from a Co(NO3)2 solution in phosphate buffer and quantify Co uptake into the catalytic film. As deposited, the film shows predominantly a Co(II) EPR signal, which converts into a Co(IV) signal as the electrode potential is increased. A purpose-built spectroelectrochemical cell allowed us to quantify the extent of Co(II) to Co(IV) conversion as a function of potential bias under operating conditions. Consistent with its role as an intermediate, Co(IV) is formed at potentials commensurate with electrocatalytic O2 evolution (+1.2 V, vs. SHE). The EPR resonance position of the Co(IV) species shifts to higher fields as the potential is increased above 1.2 V. Such a shift of the Co(IV) signal may be assigned to changes in the local Co structure, displaying a more distorted ligand field or more ligand radical character, suggesting it is this subset of sites that represents the catalytically ‘active’ component. The described spectroelectrochemical approach provides new information on catalyst function and reaction pathways of water oxidation.},

During the overdischarge process, batteries experience a stage where a violent electro-thermal behavior is exhibited, involving sharp decreases in the voltage and current, and a fierce increase in the surface temperature; moreover, several parameters such as the discharge capacity, energy density, and internal resistances are all increased after overdischarge. Besides, a poor rate capacity and serious capacity degradation can also be seen during the overdischarge cycling, which is further reflected by the evolution of battery surface temperature, charge/discharge voltage, and internal resistances. What is more, it is found that battery electro-thermal parameters, eg, temperature rise, degradation rate, and internal resistances, increase exponentially as overdischarge deepens. Finally, a high-temperature environment is verified to deteriorate the degradation of overdischarged battery.},

Several parameters are measured, including mass loss rate, time to ignition, time to explosion, heat release rate (HRR), the surface temperature and concentration of toxic gases. Although small quantities of oxygen are released from the lithium ion battery during burning, it is estimated that the energy, consuming oxygen released from the lithium ion battery, accounts for less than 13% of total energy released by a fully charged lithium ion battery. The experimental results show that the peak HRR and concentration of toxic gases rise with the increasing the states of charge, whereas the time to ignition and time to explosion decrease.

Electropolymerization of the pendant aniline groups in the copolymer gave a layer of polynorbornene populated with the redox-active TEMPO pendants, in which polyaniline chain was incorporated. Electroactivity of the TEMPO pendants throughout the layer and its excellent charging/discharging cyclability, in addition to the amorphous nature of the layer, suggested that the polyaniline chain was homogeneously dispersed in the layer and that each chain served as crosslinking moiety. The effect of the polyaniline chains was further enhanced when they were formed by in-situ electropolymerization of the aniline group in the preformed layer of the copolymer/polyaniline composite. The polyaniline chain served as a conducting path to reduce the charge-transfer resistance for redox mediation, which gave rise to an excellent rate performance for the charging/discharging process of the layer, compared with those for the composite layers of TEMPO-substituted polymers with polyaniline and other conductive additives prepared by the conventional grinding methods.},

The EPR-detected state of charge (ESOC), as inferred from the number of paramagnetic centers in the film, is compared to the results of Coulomb counting based on galvanostatic charging. Spin concentration, longitudinal relaxation times T1 and phase memory times Tm strongly correlate with the ESOC. In the discharged film, the spin concentration reaches 5±3×1020 cm−3, causing a phase memory time Tm≪ 100 ns (shorter than the resonator ring-down time) that hinders the detection of the spin echo. In the charged film, the decreased spin concentration results in a longer Tm between 100 ns and 300 ns that enables spin-echo detection, yet limits the length of the microwave pulse sequence. The short, broad-band pulses cause instantaneous diffusion in the unoxidized domains across the oxidized film, affecting the relative peak intensities in the pulsed EPR spectrum. By simulating the spectral distortion caused by instantaneous diffusion, we obtain information on the local spin concentration, which complements the information on the ‘bulk’ spin concentration determined by electrochemistry and continuous-wave EPR spectroscopy.},

   abstract = {Redox polymers bearing stable nitroxyl radical groups, such as poly-TEMPO-methacrylate (PTMA), are attractive candidates for application in power sources of novel kind, which combine the high power output of supercapacitors and high energy of rechargeable batteries. An important advantage of PTMA is the availability and low cost of the starting materials combined with high charging/discharging voltage, fast electron transfer kinetics and good mechanical properties of the polymer. However, low electron conductivity and high solubility in common organic electrolytes hamper the broad application of TEMPO-based compounds as cathode materials. In the present work, we report a simple strategy to overcome these limitations by the use of a practical and polymer-rich electrode based on redox-conducting polymer blends of polymerized nickel complexes with salen-type Schiff bases and PTMA. Electrochemical properties of the material are tested both in thin film systems and in asymmetric supercapacitor prototypes with aqueous electrolyte, which demonstrate high specific capacity (83 mAh g−1 at 1C, 53 mAh g−1 at 5C and 47 mAh g−1 at 10C), high rate capability as well as cycling stability (55% capacity retention after 1000 cycles).},

It is one of the key new energy storage products developed in the 21st century. However, the performance of supercapacitors is limited by its electrode materials and electrolytes. At the same time, with the application of supercapacitors in electric vehicles and renewable energy systems, thermal safety issues have become increasingly prominent. A proper thermal management system can control the temperature of the supercapacitor module during charging and discharging, which is crucial to ensure the performance and safety of the energy storage system. Among various cooling technologies, phase change material (PCM) has been widely used due to its simple structure, good cooling effect, and no additional energy consumption. In this paper, the principle, characteristics, electrode material types, electrolyte types and research progress of PCM materials in supercapacitor thermal management systems are reviewed. Finally, an overview of the current application of supercapacitors is pointed out, and the future development direction is prospected.},

   abstract = {Organic radical batteries (ORBs) represent a viable pathway to a more sustainable energy storage technology compared to conventional Li-ion batteries. For further materials and cell development towards competitive energy and power densities, a deeper understanding of electron transport and conductivity in organic radical polymer cathodes is required. Such electron transport is characterised by electron hopping processes, which depend on the presence of closely spaced hopping sites. Using a combination of electrochemical, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic, and theoretical molecular dynamics as well as density functional theory modelling techniques, we explored how compositional characteristics of cross-linked poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) polymers govern electron hopping and rationalise their impact on ORB performance. Electrochemistry and EPR spectroscopy not only show a correlation between capacity and the total number of radicals in an ORB using a PTMA cathode, but also indicates that the state-of-health degrades about twice as fast if the amount of radical is reduced by 15%. The presence of up to 3% free monomer radicals did not improve fast charging capabilities. Pulsed EPR indicated that these radicals readily dissolve into the electrolyte but a direct effect on battery degradation could not be shown. However, a qualitative impact cannot be excluded either. The work further illustrates that nitroxide units have a high affinity to the carbon black conductive additive, indicating the possibility of its participation in electron hopping. At the same time, the polymers attempt to adopt a compact conformation to increase radical–radical contact. Hence, a kinetic competition exists, which might gradually be altered towards a thermodynamically more stable configuration by repeated cycling, yet further investigations are required for its characterisation.},

The drug loaded hydrogel samples were characterized with variable-temperature dependent EPR experiment, and EPR theoretical lineshape analysis. It was found that CT molecules reside in the hydrophobic Rf-cores/IPDU shells of the Rf-PEG micelles and the maximum molecular-level loading capacity was estimated to be 18.8 mg per gram of the Rf-PEG. It has been known that Rf-PEG hydrogel with certain molecular masses for the fluoroalkyl group and the PEG chain shows properties of sol/gel phase coexistence and surface erosion, which represent the favorable condition for a pharmaceutical depot to control the kinetics of drug release. To evaluate the Rf-PEG's biocompatibility and kinetics of the drug release, a cell proliferation assay was carried out on human oropharyngeal carcinoma (KB) cells. The results show that R f-PEG is biocompatible and able to release CT to the cell media with a constant equilibrium concentration independent of the amount of CT loaded hydrogel. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

For charge storage applications that take advantage of the redox-active nature of stable radical polymers, enhanced conductivity would improve performance. To explore the interplay between stable radicals and a conjugated backbone, we prepared and studied soluble polythiophene with high regioregularity and various concentrations of pendent radical groups to systematically examine any change in conductivity with radical incorporation. Using electron paramagnetic resonance and electrical conductivity measurements, we show that there is an exponential decrease in conductivity as we increase the percentage of pendent groups attached to repeating units, which changes the conductivity by 6 orders of magnitude between the nonradical control polythiophene material and the material with the highest radical content (∼80%). These findings serve as an important guide to the future design of radical polymers on conjugated backbones with the goal of tuning conductivity as a function of stable radical content in redox-active energy storage applications.},

   abstract = {We have investigated the eftect of photoinduced electron transfer on the photoconductivity (PC) of conducting polymer-C6& films by comparing the photoconductivity (carrier generation and carrier transport) of the conducting polymer sensitized with C6p with that of the conducting polymer alone. We present time-resolved transient PC results, subnanosecond to 0.5 ps, obtained from poly[2-methoxy, 5-(2'-ethyl-hexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) and poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT), and from conducting polymer films sensitized with several concentrations of C6p. Both the magnitude and the lifetime of the transient PC increase substantially on increasing the concentration of C6p. The results imply that quantum efficiency for photogeneration of charge carriers is increased by photoinduced electron transfer and that early time recombination is inhibited by the spatial separation of the electron and hole on the C6p and the conducting polymer, respectively. The greater enhancement of the transient PC in MEH-PPV (nearly two orders of magnitude with the addition of a few percent of C6p) than in P3OT (nearly one order of magnitude with the addition of a comparable amount of C6o) suggests a higher probability of early time recombination in pristine MEH-PPV. As a result of the enhancement in the photo-generation efficiency and the carrier lifetime, the spectral response of the steady-state PC in both MEH-PPV/C6p and P3OT/C6p films is significantly enhanced throughout the entire spectral range from the near infrared to the ultraviolet.},

   abstract = {The market for stationary battery storage systems (BSS) has been growing strongly around the world for several years. The areas of application for BSS range from ancillary services, to reductions in commercial power prices, to an increase in solar self-consumption in private homes. This wide range of applications, combined with the strong market growth, has led to significant research in the field of BSS. The central topics of these research activities include the simulation of BSS in renewable energy systems, the development of operating strategies and the economic evaluation of these. However, the young market lacks transparency and the underlying assumptions about prices and battery dimensions often do not correspond to reality. To address this issue, this paper provides detailed information about the markets of home storage systems (HSS), industrial storage systems (ISS), and large-scale storage systems (LSS) in Germany. We have been continuously building a database on the HSS and ISS market with accompanying research on subsidy programs and additional research. Furthermore, we have compiled the dataset on LSS in parallel through constant research and publish it with this paper. Our analyses show that by the end of 2018, a total of 125,000 HSS, with a battery power of about 415 MW and battery capacity of 930 MWh, had been installed in Germany. The current state of the ISS database, however, does not allow sharp estimates on the overall German ISS market, but shows the wide capacity and power ranges from some kW / kWh to nearly one MW / MWh for these systems. The 59 LSS have an accumulated power of 400 MW and a capacity of about 550 MWh. They operate mainly in the market of frequency containment reserve (FCR). Lithium-ion technologies dominate the HSS and LSS markets with high shares. The specific prices of this technology have fallen by more than 50% in recent years and were around 1,150 €/kWh in the HSS market and 800 €/kWh in the LSS market in 2018.

The parameters Aiso, giso, Azz, and gxx of MTSSL were found to be sensitive to changes in solvent properties, where A-values increased and g-values decreased due to increased solvent polarity or proticity. A linear correlation was found for the isotropic (giso, Aiso) and anisotropic (gxx, Azz) parameters, respectively. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the same parameters were performed for a model spin label with the possibility to vary the dielectric constant (ε) of the medium and the number of hydrogen bonds formed with the nitroxide oxygen. From a qualitative analysis of experimental and calculated results, it was possible to specify the causes of the parameter shifts in more detail. In the "apolar region" (ε < 25), the sensitivity of Aiso and Azz to ε is large. However, in the "polar region" (ε > 25), the sensitivity to epsi; is small, and the shifts in Aiso and Azz are mainly determined by the proticity of the solvent. Methanol was found to form ∼1 and water ∼2 hydrogen bonds to the nitroxide on average. The DFT method determined the shifts in giso and gxx due to hydrogen bonding more accurately compared with the restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock method. The anisotropic spin label-solvent data can be used in the interpretation of rigid-limit data from spin-labeled proteins to gain further insight in local environmental properties.},

@article{Feynman_1949,
   abstract = {In this paper two things are done. (1) It is shown that a considerable simplification can be attained in writing down matrix elements for complex processes in electrodynamics. Further, a physical point of view is available which permits them to be written down directly for any specific problem. Being simply a restatement of conventional electrodynamics, however, the matrix elements diverge for complex processes. (2) Electrodynamics is modified by altering the interaction of electrons at short distances, All matrix elements are now finite, with the exception of those relating to problems of vacuum polarization. The latter are evaluated in a manner suggested by Pauli and Bethe, which gives 6nite results for these matrices also. The only effects sensitive to the modification are changes in mass and charge of the electrons. Such changes could not be directly observed. Phenomena directly observable, are insensitive to the details of the modi6cation used (except at extreme energies). For such phenomena, a limit can be taken as the range of the modification goes to zero. The results then agree with those of Schwinger. A complete, unambiguous, and presumably consistent, method is therefore available for the calculation of all processes involving electrons and photons. The simpli6cation in writing the expressions results from an emphasis on the overall space-time view resulting from a study of the solution of the equations of electrodynamics, The relation of this to the more conventional Hamiltonian point of view is discussed. It would be very difficult to make the modification which is proposed if one insisted on having the equations in Hamiltonian form. The methods apply as well to charges obeying the Klein-Gordon equation, and to the various meson theories of nuclear forces. Illustrative examples are given. Although a modi6cation like that used in electrodynamics can make all matrices finite for all of the meson theories, for some of the theories it is no longer true that all directly observable phenomena are insensitive to the details of the modification used. The actual evaluation of integrals appearing in the matrix elements may be facilitated, in the simpler cases, by methods described in the appendix. HIS paper should be considered as a direct continuation of a preceding one' (I) in which the motion of electrons, neglecting interaction, was analyzed , by dealing directly with the solution of the Hamiltonian diGerential equations. Here the same technique is applied to include interactions and in that way to express in simple terms the solution of problems in quantum electrodynamics. For most practical calculations in quantum electro-dynamics the solution is ordinarily expressed in terms of a matrix element. The matrix is worked out as an expansion in powers of e'/kc, the successive terms corresponding to the inclusion of an increasing number of virtual quanta. It appears that a considerable simplification can be achieved in writing down these matrix elements for complex processes. Furthermore, each term in the expansion can be written down and understood directly from a physical point of view, similar to the space-time view in I. It is the purpose of this paper to describe how this may be done. We shall also discuss methods of handling the divergent integrals which appear in these matrix elements. The simplihcation in the formulae results mainly from the fact that previous methods unnecessarily separated into individual terms processes that were closely related physically. For example, in the exchange of a quantum between two electrons there were two terms depending on which electron emitted and which absorbed the quantum. Yet, in the virtual states considered, timing relations are not significant. Olny the order of operators t P positive energy electrons are involved. Further, the eBects of longitudinal and transverse waves can be combined together. The separations previously made were on an unrelativistic basis (reflected in the circumstance that apparently momentum but not energy is conserved in intermediate states). When the terms are combined and simplified, the relativistic invariance of the result is self-evident. We begin by discussing the solution in space and time of the Schrodinger equation for particles interacting instantaneously. The results are immediately general-izable to delayed interactions of relativistic electrons and we represent in that way the laws of quantum electrodynamics. We can then see how the matrix element for any process can be written down directly. In particular, the self-energy expression is written down. So far, nothing has been done other than a restate-rnent of conventional electrodynamics in other terms. Therefore, the self-energy diverges. A modification' in interaction between charges is next made, and it is shown that the self-energy is made convergent and corresponds to a correction to the electron mass. After the mass correction is made, other real processes are finite and insensitive to the "width" of the cut-o8 in the interaction. '},

@article{Vleck1948,
   abstract = {In regular crystals, the width of the absorption lines arising from the magnetic moment of the electron or nucleus is caused primarily by the interaction between the magnetic dipoles. It is prohibitively difficult to determine the precise shape of the absorption line theoretically, but the invariance of the diagonal sum in quantum mechanics permits the calculation of the second moment of the frequency deviation, and hence the r.m.s. line breadth. The latter agrees excellently with the observations of Pake and Purcell on the magnetic absorption of the F nucleus in CaFg, both in absolute magnitude, and in the dependence on the direction between the magnetic field and the principal cubic axes. The fourth moment was also computed to examine how good an approximation is the conventional assumption of a Gaussian shape. As long as no exchange is present (the nuclear case) the Gaussian model is moderately good. For the 100 direction in a cubic crystal, the theoretical ratio of root mean fourth to root mean square breadth is 1.25. Pake and Purcell's measurements yield 1.24. A Gaussian model would require 1.32. The theory is extended to include crystals with two kinds of spin moments (two types of nuclei, or simultaneous nuclear and electronic spin). Coupling between unlike moments is less eRective (by a factor-', in the r.m. s. width) than that between like in broadening the lines. In the paramagnetic absorption caused by electronic spin, it is imperative to include the eRect of exchange coupling. This interaction does not contribute to the second moment, but greatly increases the fourth. As a result, the lines are peaked much more sharply than one would compute from the second moment with the Gaussian model for line shape. This "exchange narrowing" explains why microwave paramagnetic absorption lines are much narrower than one first conjectures from the amount of dipolar coupling. The theoretical calculations are given in Sections II-IU. The final sections V-VI give the comparison with the experiments of Pake and Purcell, and with the model of Bloembergen, Purcell, and Pound, for r-f absorption in liquids. L INTRODUCTION HE present paper'deals with the broadening of the absorption lines of crystals by dipoiar interaction, with emphasis primarily on the r-f and microwave regions. The theory is much better tested by measurements in these domains than at ordinary optical wavelengths since with the latter the line broadening is exceedingly small compared to the proper frequency and also it may not be safe to neglect, as we do, the inHuence of Doppler and radiation broadening. We shall deal exclusively with media in which the atoms are regularly spaced, i e. , with crystals. The material may, however, be either a single crystal or a powder. The broadening which we consider is caused essentially by the mag-netostatic interaction of the atomic dipoles, and is hence "adiabatic" in character. The mechanism is thus quite diferent from that in gases, where non-adiabatic collisions are the main factor, as shown in the theory of Bloembergen, Purcell, and Pound. ' i A preliminary account of the present paper was given at the 194'7 Chicago meeting of the American Physical Society. For abstract see Phys. Rev. V3, 1229 (1948). ~N. Bloembergen, E. M. Purce11, an& R, V. Pound, Phys. Rev. V3, 679 (1948), We shall assume throughout that the moments responsible for the absorption are magnetic, and arise from spin, be it nuclear or electronic. The inHuence of the crystalline electric field will be neglected, and the material will be supposed non-ferromagnetic. This procedure is well warranted in experiments on nuclear resonance absorption. The efkct of the crystalline Stark eGect on the absorption by electronic spin will be examined in a later paper. In another article the theory will be extended to the ferromagnetic case to provide a microscopic derivation of the Kittel formula for the resonance frequency. The energy terms attributable to magnetic spin-spin interaction and to application of the external constant magnetic field will be called, respectively, the dipolar and Zeeman energies. We believe that these names are less ambiguous than the word magnetic, which can relate to either term according to the usage of the author. It will be supposed throughout that the applied field is su%ciently large that the dipolar interaction is small compared to the Zeeman member. This condition is fulfilled at the field strengths used in most experiments on resonance absorp-ii68},

   abstract = {Refocalization sequences in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can in principle reverse the coherent evolution under the secular dipolar Hamiltonian of a closed system. We use this experimental strategy to study the effect of irreversible decoherence on the signal amplitude attenuation in a single-crystal hydrated salt where the nuclear spin system consists of the set of hydration water proton spins having a strong coupling within each pair and a much weaker coupling with other pairs. We study the experimental response of attenuation times with temperature, crystal orientation with respect to the external magnetic field, and rf pulse amplitudes. We find that the observed attenuation of the refocalized signals can be explained by two independent mechanisms: (a) evolution under the nonsecular terms of the reversion Hamiltonian, and (b) an intrinsic mechanism having the attributes of irreversible decoherence induced by the coupling with a quantum environment. To characterize (a) we compare the experimental data with the numerical calculation of the refocalized NMR signal of an artificial, closed spin system. To describe (b) we use a model of the irreversible adiabatic decoherence of spin pairs coupled with a phonon bath which allows evaluating an upper bound for the decoherence times. This model accounts for both the observed dependence of the decoherence times on the eigenvalues of the spin-environment Hamiltonian, and the independence from the sample temperature. This result, then, supports the adiabatic decoherence induced by the dipole-phonon coupling as the explanation for the observed irreversible decay of reverted NMR signals in solids.},

In this first study it is shown that by modulating the morphology of the n-type contact layer from amorphous to microcrystalline, pronounced changes in the pEDMR spectra may be observed. Due to the fact that pEDMR allows a deconvolution of the spin-dependent signals in time as well as in magnetic field domain, we were able to significantly reduce the complexity of the spectra compared to conventional EDMR. In the samples containing amorphous n-type contact layers we found signals from shallow localized conduction band tail states and phosphorous donor states. Upon replacement of this layer by its microcrystalline counterpart both signals disappeared.

   abstract = {The multiline signal of the S2 state in Photosystem II was measured both in frozen-solution and single-crystal preparations from the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The frozen-solution EPR spectrum shows a gaussian-like line shape without any resolution of Mn hyperfine couplings. This line shape can be understood on the basis of the single-crystal spectra, where a strong orientation dependence of partially resolved hyperfine structures appears. Simulation of the frozen-solution spectrum on the basis of Mn hyperfine couplings taken from published pulse-ENDOR data yields a fully rhombic g-matrix for the multiline signal with principal components 1.997, 1.970, and 1.965. The resulting isotropic g-value giso = 1.977 is surprisingly small compared to other manganese complexes containing manganese ions in the formal oxidation states three and four. © 2006 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

   abstract = {A theoretical description of pulsed reaction yield detected magnetic resonance (RYDMR) is proposed. In RYDMR, magnetic resonance spectra of radical pairs (RPs) are indirectly detected by monitoring their recombination yield. Such a detection method is significantly more sensitive than conventional electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), but design of appropriate pulse sequences for RYDMR requires additional effort because of a different observable. In this work various schemes for generating spin-echo like signals and detecting them by RYDMR are treated. Specifically, we consider refocusing of zero-quantum coherences (ZQCs) and single-quantum coherences (SQCs) by selective as well as by non-selective pulses and formulate a general analytical approach to pulsed RYDMR, which makes an efficient use of the product operator formalism. We anticipate that these results are of importance for RYDMR studies of elusive paramagnetic particles, notably, in organic semiconductors.},

   abstract = {Due to the fact that lithium ions are subjected to different thermal abuses during services, this paper introduces heating of lithium-ion batteries with different State of Charge (SOC) by means of a spring heating ring and a cylindrical heating rod. The results show that with the increase of SOC, the thermal runaway phenomenon of lithium-ion battery increases dramatically. Under the same SOC, owing to the better heat transfer efficiency of the spring heating coil and the more uniform internal heating of the battery, the temperature of the battery heated by cylindrical heating rod and the start temperature of thermal runaway are higher than that of the battery heated by spring heating coil. The energy required to cause thermal runaway of battery decreases with the increase of SOC. The first decrease of battery voltage is the signal of obvious self-generated heat inside the battery. Under the same SOC, the battery heated by cylindrical heating rod needs to absorb more heat to touch the thermal runaway. The battery will produce toxic gas after thermal runaway, and the severity of battery thermal runaway directly affects the proportion of electrolyte. This work can provide some guidance for the domino effect and early warning of thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries.},

In the current study, 18650 lithium ion batteries at different states of charge are tested using a cone calorimeter to study the burning behaviors under an incident heat flux of 50 kW m-2. Several parameters are measured, including mass loss rate, time to ignition, time to explosion, heat release rate (HRR), the surface temperature and concentration of toxic gases. Although small quantities of oxygen are released from the lithium ion battery during burning, it is estimated that the energy, consuming oxygen released from the lithium ion battery, accounts for less than 13% of total energy released by a fully charged lithium ion battery. The experimental results show that the peak HRR and concentration of toxic gases rise with the increasing the states of charge, whereas the time to ignition and time to explosion decrease. The test results of the fully charged lithium ion batteries at three different incident heat fluxes show that the peak HRR increases from 6.2 to 9.1 kW and the maximum surface temperature increases from 662 to 934 °C as the incident heat flux increases from 30 to 60 kW m-2.},

In addition, 15-22 mg/Wh of another potentially toxic gas, phosphoryl fluoride (POF3), was measured in some of the fire tests. Gas emissions when using water mist as extinguishing agent were also investigated.

   abstract = {As the production of automotive battery cells has expanded worldwide, concerns have arisen regarding the corresponding energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, data on the energy consumption and GHG emissions of battery cell production are scarce, uncertain in quality and accuracy, and mostly outdated. To improve the availability and accuracy of battery production data, one goal of this study was to determine the energy consumption of state-of-the-art battery cell production and calculate the related GHG emissions. Machine specifications for energy consumption were gathered from multiple manufacturers during the planning and construction of a research factory in Germany with a theoretical output of 7 GWh per year of electrode capacity. The energy consumption and associated GHG emissions were determined for each step in the production process and for the process overall. It was found that only a few steps were responsible for most of the required energy and GHG emissions, with coating and drying, formation, and drying rooms consuming a combined 76% of the total energy and emitting 74% of all GHGs. A second goal was to determine the impact of internal energy sourcing on GHG emissions. It turns out that switching from a mix of electricity and natural gas to electricity only could reduce GHG emissions if the electricity used at the plant had a low GHG emission factor. In Europe, the Swedish electricity grid has the lowest GHG emission factor; the overall emissions of battery cell production could be reduced from 4.54 to 0.53 kg CO2-eq/kWh battery cell capacity if production was only powered by electricity. However, nuclear energy accounts for a large share (30%) of the electricity mix in Sweden, and is questionable from an environmental perspective.},

   abstract = {The increasing presence of Li-Ion batteries (LIB) in mobile and stationary energy storage applications has triggered a growing interest in the environmental impacts associated with their production. Numerous studies on the potential environmental impacts of LIB production and LIB-based electric mobility are available, but these are very heterogeneous and the results are therefore difficult to compare. Furthermore, the source of inventory data, which is key to the outcome of any study, is often difficult to trace back. This paper provides a review of LCA studies on Li-Ion batteries, with a focus on the battery production process. All available original studies that explicitly assess LIB production are summarized, the sources of inventory data are traced back and the main assumptions are extracted in order to provide a quick overview of the technical key parameters used in each study. These key parameters are then compared with actual battery data from industry and research institutions. Based on the results from the reviewed studies, average values for the environmental impacts of LIB production are calculated and the relevance of different assumptions for the outcomes of the different studies is pointed out. On average, producing 1 Wh of storage capacity is associated with a cumulative energy demand of 328 Wh and causes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 110 gCO2eq. Although the majority of existing studies focus on GHG emissions or energy demand, it can be shown that impacts in other categories such as toxicity might be even more important. Taking into account the importance of key parameters for the environmental performance of Li-Ion batteries, research efforts should not only focus on energy density but also on maximizing cycle life and charge-discharge efficiency.},

   abstract = {The world is shifting to electric vehicles to mitigate climate change. Here, we quantify the future demand for key battery materials, considering potential electric vehicle fleet and battery chemistry developments as well as second-use and recycling of electric vehicle batteries. We find that in a lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide dominated battery scenario, demand is estimated to increase by factors of 18–20 for lithium, 17–19 for cobalt, 28–31 for nickel, and 15–20 for most other materials from 2020 to 2050, requiring a drastic expansion of lithium, cobalt, and nickel supply chains and likely additional resource discovery. However, uncertainties are large. Key factors are the development of the electric vehicles fleet and battery capacity requirements per vehicle. If other battery chemistries were used at large scale, e.g. lithium iron phosphate or novel lithium-sulphur or lithium-air batteries, the demand for cobalt and nickel would be substantially smaller. Closed-loop recycling plays a minor, but increasingly important role for reducing primary material demand until 2050, however, advances in recycling are necessary to economically recover battery-grade materials from end-of-life batteries. Second-use of electric vehicles batteries further delays recycling potentials.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of state-of-charge estimation for rechargeable batteries. Coulomb counting is a well-known method for estimating the state of charge, and it is regarded as accurate as long as the battery capacity and the beginning state of charge are known. The Coulomb counting approach, on the other hand, is prone to inaccuracies from a variety of sources, and the magnitude of these errors has not been explored in the literature. We formally construct and quantify the state-of-charge estimate error during Coulomb counting due to four types of error sources: (1) current measurement error, (2) current integration approximation error, (3) battery capacity uncertainty, and (4) timing oscillator error/drift. It is demonstrated that the state-of-charge error produced can be either time-cumulative or state-of-charge-proportional. Time-cumulative errors accumulate over time and have the potential to render the state-of-charge estimation utterly invalid in the long term.The proportional errors of the state of charge rise with the accumulated state of charge and reach their worst value within one charge/discharge cycle. The study presents methods for reducing time-cumulative and state-of-charge-proportional mistakes through simulation analysis.},

In this paper we present the potential of Li-ion batteries to be an ideal substitution of lead-acid batteries in off-grid rural solar home systems. We defend that the mass production of Li-ion cells, to respond to industrial demand, particularly from the electric automobile industry, will benefit renewable energy and especially small size solar home systems. The electric automobile is one of the driving forces of Li-ion industry. It will indirectly allow rural zones of developing countries to access electricity at a lower cost to replace inefficient and harmful candles and kerosene lamps.

Although considerable progresses have been seen for wearable electronics, lithium rechargeable batteries, the power sources of the devices, do not keep pace with such progresses due to tenuous mechanical stabilities, causing them to remain as the limiting elements in the entire technology. Herein, we revisit the key components of the battery (current collector, binder, and separator) and replace them with the materials that support robust mechanical endurance of the battery.

   abstract = {During recent years, emissions reduction has been tightened worldwide. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) that can meet emission requirements. The growing number of new EVs increases the consumption of raw materials during production. Simultaneously, the number of used EVs and subsequently retired lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) that need to be disposed of is also increasing. According to the current approaches, the recycling process technology appears to be one of the most promising solutions for the End-of-Life (EOL) LIBs—recycling and reusing of waste materials would reduce raw materials production and environmental burden. According to this performed literature review, 263 publications about “Recycling of Lithium-ion Batteries from Electric Vehicles” were classified into five sections: Recycling Processes, Battery Composition, Environmental Impact, Economic Evaluation, and Recycling & Rest. The whole work reviews the current-state of publications dedicated to recycling LIBs from EVs in the techno-environmental-economic summary. This paper covers the first part of the review work; it is devoted to the recycling technology processes and points out the main study fields in recycling that were found during this work.},

Most research into organic electrodes has focused on the material level instead of evaluating performance in practical batteries. This Review addresses this by first providing an overview of the history and redox of organic electrode materials and then evaluating the prospects and remaining challenges of organic electrode materials for practical lithium batteries. Our evaluations are made according to energy density, power density, cycle life, gravimetric density, electronic conductivity and other relevant parameters, such as energy efficiency, cost and resource availability.

   abstract = {Low-temperature high-rate cycling leads to accelerated performance degradation of lithium-ion batteries, which seriously hampers the large-scale popularization of electric vehicles. To clarify the battery degradation characteristics and mechanisms, this work conducts an in-depth investigation on the commercial lithium-ion batteries with 37 A h during the long-term cycling under low-temperature high-rate charging. The battery capacity displays the decelerating degradation trend during the long-term cycling, and the battery capacity recovery rate is as high as 80-90%. Furthermore, it is interesting that the constant current discharge capacity exhibits jumping behavior at around 120th cycle during the discharge process. By postmortem characterization analysis, it is found that lithium plating is the primary degradation mechanism. Lithium plating exhibits nonuniformity and displays a decelerating trend in the later stage. In view of the lower temperature, the plated lithium can better retain the reaction activity, which results in a higher capacity recovery rate. Besides, lithium plating increases the internal polarization, which makes the constant current discharge capacity jump when lithium plating reaches a certain level. The findings can provide certain references for battery optimization.},

The lithium metal is deposited on the anode when the cycling rate is higher than or equal to 1.8C, which is confirmed by the tests of the incremental capacity (IC) curves, XPS, DSC and SEM. The root cause of the lithium deposition is analyzed by the available capacities of the single electrodes as well as the actual capacity ratio of anode to cathode (actual A/C ratio). The rate capability of the anodes recovered from the fresh and the aged full cells is quite poor in comparison with the cathodes. Therefore, the capacity of full cell is limited by the anode when the test rate is relatively high. In such situation, the coulombic efficiency is less than 1, and its value is slightly larger than the actual A/C ratio which is the root cause of the deposition of lithium metal. Compared with the generation of SEI film, the lithium deposition leads to an accelerated loss rate of active lithium which results in the rapid capacity fade of full cell. The research about the actual A/C ratio provides a guidance for the design of the initial reversible capacity ratio of anode to cathode (initial A/C ratio) of lithium ion batteries.},

Since many IoT devices are not rechargeable, several steps to conserve the battery life of an IoT network can be taken using the early prediction of battery life. In this study, a machine learning based model implementing a random forest regression algorithm is used to predict the battery life of IoT devices. The proposed model is experimented on ‘Beach Water Quality – Automated Sensors’ data set generated from sensors in an IoT network from the city of Chicago, USA. Several pre-processing techniques like normalisation, transformation and dimensionality reduction are used in this model. The proposed model achieved a 97% predictive accuracy.

Among, different discharge cut-off voltages (1.0, 0.5, and 0.2 V) are included. During the overdischarge process, batteries experience a stage where a violent electro-thermal behavior is exhibited, involving sharp decreases in the voltage and current, and a fierce increase in the surface temperature; moreover, several parameters such as the discharge capacity, energy density, and internal resistances are all increased after overdischarge. Besides, a poor rate capacity and serious capacity degradation can also be seen during the overdischarge cycling, which is further reflected by the evolution of battery surface temperature, charge/discharge voltage, and internal resistances. What is more, it is found that battery electro-thermal parameters, eg, temperature rise, degradation rate, and internal resistances, increase exponentially as overdischarge deepens. Finally, a high-temperature environment is verified to deteriorate the degradation of overdischarged battery.},

   abstract = {Hyperfine studies of disordered materials often yield the distribution of the electric field gradient (EFG) or related quadrupole splitting (QS). The question of the structural information that may be extracted from such distributions has been considered for more than fifteen years. Experimentally most studies have been performed using Mössbauer spectroscopy, especially on 57Fe. However, NMR, NQR, EPR and PAC methods have also received some attention. The EFG distribution for a random distribution of electric charges was for instance first investigated by Czjzek et al [1] and a general functional form was derived for the joint (bivariate) distribution of the principal EFG tensor component Vzz and the asymmetry parameter η. The importance of the Gauss distribution for such rotationally invariant structural models was thus evidenced. Extensions of that model which are based on degenerate multivariate Gauss distributions for the elements of the EFG tensor were proposed by Czjzek. The latter extensions have been used since that time, more particularly in Mössbauer spectroscopy, under the name 'shell models'. The mathematical foundations of all the previous models are presented and critically discussed as they are evidenced by simple calculations in the case of the EFG tensor. The present article only focuses on those aspects of the EFG distribution in disordered solids which can be discussed without explicitly looking at particular physical mechanisms. We present studies of three different model systems. A reference model directly related to the first model of Czjzek, called the Gaussian isotropic model (GIM), is shown to be the limiting case for many different models with a large number of independent contributions to the EFG tensor and not restricted to a point-charge model. The extended validity of the marginal distribution of η in the GIM model is discussed. It is also shown that the second model based on degenerate multivariate normal distributions for the EFG components yields questionable results and has been exaggeratedly used in experimental studies. The latter models are further discussed in the light of new results. The problems raised by these extensions are due to the fact that the consequences of the statistical invariance by rotation of the EFG tensor have not been sufficiently taken into account. Further difficulties arise because the structural degrees of freedom of the disordered solid under consideration have been confused with the degrees of freedom of QS distributions. The relations which are derived and discussed are further illustrated by the case of the EFG tensor distribution created at the centre of a sphere by m charges randomly distributed on its surface. The third model, a simple extension of the GIM, considers the case of an EFG tensor which is the sum of a fixed part and of a random part with variable weights. The bivariate distribution f(Vzz, η) is calculated exactly in the most symmetric case and the effect of the random part is investigated as a function of its weight. The various models are more particularly discussed in connection with short-range order in disordered solids. An ambiguity problem which arises in the evaluation of bivariate distributions of centre lineshift (isomer shift) and quadrupole splitting from 1/2 ↔ 3/2 Mössbauer spectra is finally quantitatively considered.},

Presently, revamped interest in anode materials is observed -- primarily graphite electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. Here, we focus on the upper limit of lithium intercalation in the morphologically quasi-ideal highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), with a LiC$_6$ stoichiometry corresponding to 100\% state of charge (SOC). We prepared a sample by immersion in liquid lithium at ambient pressure and investigated it by static $^7$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We resolved unexpected signatures of superdense intercalation compounds, LiC$_\{6-x\}$. These have been ruled out for decades, since the highest geometrically accessible composition, LiC$_2$, can only be prepared under high pressure. We thus challenge the widespread notion that any additional intercalation beyond LiC$_6$ is not possible under ambient conditions. We monitored the sample upon calendaric aging and employed ab initio calculations to rationalise the NMR results. The computed relative stabilities of different superdense configurations reveal that non-negligible overintercalation does proceed spontaneously beyond the currently accepted capacity limit.},

Comparison with the small molecular spin probe Tempone shows that the dynamics of peptide molecules is determined by their structure and not by the surrounding medium. At the terminal positions (position 1 and 8) TOAC residues were found to be more flexible than at the central 4th position. Instantaneous diffusion mechanism in electron spin echo, which also contributes to the ED EPR spectra, was employed for deriving the local concentration of peptaibols.

The decay kinetics is calculated numerically for the cases in which the spin-flip rate W and the time of the decay kinetics observation τ are interconnected as Wτ ≈ 1; analytical expressions are obtained for Wτ ≫1, Wτ ≪ 1. Analogous calculations are carried out for spin-flip rate distributions. The calculated data are compared with experiment for the decay kinetics of SO4- ion radicals studied over a wide range of Tτ values. The calculations show a fairly good fit to experiment. © 1981.},

   abstract = {The electronic g factor carries highly useful information about the electronic structure of a paramagnetic species, such as spin-orbit coupling and dia- or paramagnetic (de-)shielding due to local fields of surrounding electron pairs. However, in many cases, a near “spin-only” case is observed, in particular for light elements, necessitating accurate and precise measurement of the g factors. Such measurement is typically impeded by a “chicken and egg situation”: internal or external reference standards are used for relative comparison of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) Larmor frequencies. However, the g factor of the standard itself usually is subject to a significant uncertainty which directly limits the precision and/or accuracy of the sought after sample g factor. Here, we apply an EPR reference-free approach for determining the g factor of atomic nitrogen trapped within the endohedral fullerene C60:N@C60 in its polycrystalline state by measuring the 1H NMR resonance frequency of dispersing toluene at room temperature. We found a value of g=2.00204(4) with a finally reached relative precision of ∼20 ppm. This accurate measurement allows us to directly compare the electronic properties of N@C60 to those found in atomic nitrogen in the gas phase or trapped in other solid matrices at liquid helium temperature. We conclude that spin-orbit coupling in N@C60 at room temperature is very similar in magnitude and of same sign as found in other inert solid matrices and that interactions between the quartet spin system and the C60 molecular orbitals are thus negligible.},

The crystals were grown from a solution of PS II core complexes from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. The core complexes contain at least 17 subunits, including the water-oxidizing complex, and 32 chlorophyll a molecules per PS II complex. The PS II complexes are active in light-induced electron transfer and water oxidation. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with four dimers of PS II complexes per unit cell. Laser excitation was used to generate the recombination triplet state in PS II which was then studied by EPR at low temperatures (10 K). The crystal spectra show the same magnitude of the zero-field splitting (ZFS) values D, E as spectra obtained earlier for the triplet state of PS II in frozen solution. The orientation of the ZFS tensor D of the triplet state with respect to the crystallographic axes has been deduced from the analysis of angular-dependent EPR spectra. Knowledge of the orientation of the D tensor component perpendicular to the plane of the chlorophyll (DZ) allows an assignment on which chlorophyll of the reaction centre the triplet state is localized at low temperatures. Furthermore, the orientation of the DX and DY components of the D tensor yielded the in-plane orientation of the respective chlorophyll in the reaction centre providing first experimental evidence for the orientation of this molecule in the PS II. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Imaging of lithium-ion dynamics during battery operation (operando imaging) at present requires sophisticated synchrotron X-ray1–7 or electron microscopy8,9 techniques, which do not lend themselves to high-throughput material screening. This limits rapid and rational materials improvements. Here we introduce a simple laboratory-based, optical interferometric scattering microscope10–13 to resolve nanoscopic lithium-ion dynamics in battery materials, and apply it to follow cycling of individual particles of the archetypal cathode material14,15, LixCoO2, within an electrode matrix. We visualize the insulator-to-metal, solid solution and lithium ordering phase transitions directly and determine rates of lithium diffusion at the single-particle level, identifying different mechanisms on charge and discharge. Finally, we capture the dynamic formation of domain boundaries between different crystal orientations associated with the monoclinic lattice distortion at the Li0.5CoO2 composition16. The high-throughput nature of our methodology allows many particles to be sampled across the entire electrode and in future will enable exploration of the role of dislocations, morphologies and cycling rate on battery degradation. The generality of our imaging concept means that it can be applied to study any battery electrode, and more broadly, systems where the transport of ions is associated with electronic or structural changes. Such systems include nanoionic films, ionic conducting polymers, photocatalytic materials and memristors.},

   abstract = {Photogenerated short-lived radical pairs (RP) are common in biological photoprocesses such as photosynthesis and enzymatic DNA repair. They can be favorably probed by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods with adequate time resolution. Two EPR techniques have proven to be particularly useful to extract information on the working states of photoinduced biological processes that is only difficult or sometimes even impossible to obtain by other types of spectroscopy. Firstly, transient EPR yields crucial information on the chemical nature and the geometry of the individual RP halves in a doublet-spin pair generated by a short laser pulse. This time-resolved method is applicable in all magnetic field/microwave frequency regimes that are used for continuous-wave EPR, and is nowadays routinely utilized with a time resolution reaching about 10 ns. Secondly, a pulsed EPR method named out-of-phase electron spin echo envelope modulation (OOP-ESEEM) is increasingly becoming popular. By this pulsed technique, the mutual spin-spin interaction between the RP halves in a doublet-spin pair manifests itself as an echo modulation detected as a function of the microwave-pulse spacing of a two-pulse echo sequence subsequent to a laser pulse. From the dipolar coupling, the distance between the radicals is readily derived. Since the spin-spin interaction parameters are typically not observable by transient EPR, the two techniques complement each other favorably. Both EPR methods have recently been applied to a variety of light-induced RPs in photobiology. This review summarizes the results obtained from such studies in the fields of plant and bacterial photosynthesis and DNA repair mediated by the enzyme DNA photolyase. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Our results obtained from solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) as electron donor and a fullerene-based electron acceptor show that the resonant signals observed in low-temperature (T=80K) trEDMR spectra can be attributed to positive polarons in the polymer as well as negative polarons in the fullerene phase, indicating that both centers are involved in spin-dependent processes that directly influence the photocurrent.},

The comparative analysis of the in situ ESR and UV–vis–NIR (including low-energy NIR range) spectra of poly-[Ni(Schiff)] films recorded during their oxidation at ambient temperature was performed, which allowed us to monitor the formation of different charge carriers in the polymer at different doping levels and elucidate their structure as well as the extent of their delocalization. The polymer doping level achieved by its oxidation within selected range of potentials was determined by combining the results of cyclic voltammetry and QCM measurements. The influence of the substituents in the diamine backbone and phenolate moieties of the ligand on the spectroscopic properties of the oxidized polymers and number of electrons per monomer unit exchanged in the redox processes was studied in detail. Integration of data from all techniques allowed us to propose the existence of both inter- and intrachain delocalization of radical cations generated in the doped polymers and show that the highest doping levels (up to two positive charges per a monomer unit) are attained in the poly-[Ni(Schiff)] films with highly localized biphenoxyl radical cations.},

   abstract = {Pulsed multi-frequency electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) at X-, Q- and W-Band (9.7, 34, and 94 GHz) was applied to investigate paramagnetic centers in microcrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells under illumination. The EDMR spectra are decomposed into resonances of conduction band tail states (e states) and phosphorus donor states (P states) from the amorphous layer and localized states near the conduction band (CE states) in the microcrystalline layer. The e resonance has a symmetric profile at all three frequencies, whereas the CE resonance reveals an asymmetry especially at W-band. This is suggested to be due to a size distribution of Si crystallites in the microcrystalline material. A gain in spectral resolution for the e and CE resonances at high fields and frequencies demonstrates the advantages of high-field EDMR for investigating devices of disordered Si. The microwave frequency independence of the EDMR spectra indicates that a spin-dependent process independent of thermal spin-polarization is responsible for the EDMR signals observed at X-, Q- and W-band. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The excitons possess a rather delocalized wave function, couple to electron spins in conduction band tail states nearby, and take part in a spin-dependent recombination process.

   abstract = {Automation has become an essential component of modern scientific instruments which often capture large amounts of complex dynamic data. Algorithms are developed to read multiple sensors in parallel with data acquisition and to adjust instrumental parameters on the fly. Decisions are made on a time scale unattainable to the human operator. In addition to speed, automation reduces human error, improves the reproducibility of experiments, and improves the reliability of acquired data. An automatic digital control (ADiC) was developed to reliably sustain critical coupling of a resonator over a wide range of time-varying loading conditions. The ADiC uses the computational power of a microcontroller that directly communicates with all system components independent of a personal computer (PC). The PC initiates resonator tuning and coupling by sending a command to MC via serial port. After receiving the command, ADiC establishes critical coupling conditions within approximately 5 ms. A printed circuit board resonator was designed to permit digital control. The performance of the resonator together with the ADiC was evaluated by varying the resonator loading from empty to heavily loaded. For the loading, samples containing aqueous sodium chloride that strongly absorb electromagnetic waves were used. A previously reported rapid scan (RS) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging instrument was upgraded by the incorporation of ADiC. RS spectra and an in vivo image of oxygen in a mouse tumor model have been acquired using the upgraded system. ADiC robustly sustained critical coupling of the resonator to the transmission line during these measurements. The design implemented in this study can be used in slow-scan and pulsed EPR with modifications.},

The design is suited for pulse LOD EPR and amplitude-modulated cw LOD EPR experiments. The sensitivity is substantially increased compared with earlier designs. Two new pulse schemes that take full advantage of the special properties of the setup are invented. In transientnutation longitudinally detected EPR (TN-LOD EPR), the nutation of magnetization during a microwave pulse is used to measure the EPR signal. In pulse-train excited longitudinally detected EPR (PT-LOD EPR), a train of microwave pulses that periodically inverts the magnetization is applied.

   abstract = {Structural information at atomic resolution of biomolecular assemblies, such as RNA and RNA protein complexes, is fundamental to comprehend biological function. Modern spectroscopic methods offer exceptional opportunities in this direction. Here we present the capability of pulse EPR to report high-resolution long-range distances in RNAs by means of a recently developed spin labeled nucleotide, which carries the TEMPO group directly attached to the nucleobase and preserves Watson-Crick base-pairing. In a representative RNA duplex with spin-label separations up to 28 base pairs (≈8 nm) we demonstrate that the label allows for a model-free conversion of inter-spin distances into base-pair separation (Δbp) if broad-band pulse excitation at Q band frequencies (34 GHz) is applied. The observed distance distribution increases from ±0.2 nm for Δbp = 10 to only ±0.5 nm for Δbp = 28, consistent with only small deviations from the "ideal" A-form RNA structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations conducted at 20 °C show restricted conformational freedom of the label. MD-generated structural deviations from an "ideal" A-RNA geometry help disentangle the contributions of local flexibility of the label and its neighboring nucleobases and global deformations of the RNA double helix to the experimental distance distributions. The study demonstrates that our simple but strategic spin labeling procedure can access detailed structural information on RNAs at atomic resolution over distances that match the size of macromolecular RNA complexes.},

This work deals with the synthesis of this new polymer functionalized by a redox nitroxide. Fine structural characterization using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques established that: 1) the nitroxide radicals are properly attached to the radical chain (continuous wave EPR) and 2) the polymer chain has very rigid conformations leading to a set of well-defined distances between first neighboring pairs of nitroxides (pulsed EPR). The redox group combined with the electroactive polymer showed not only a very high electrochemical reversibility but also a perfect match of redox potentials between the de-/doping reaction of the bisthiophene carbazole backbone and the redox activity of the nitroxide radical. This new organic electrode shows a stable capacity (about 60 mAh g−1) and enables a strong reduction in the amount of carbon additive due to the conducting-polymer skeleton.},

The effect on the nuclear magnetic resonance of saturating the electron spin resonance in several appropriate systems was observed at low fields and room temperatures. The systems investigated were: metallic Li, metallic Na, and Na dissolved in anhydrous liquid ammonia. The nuclear resonances of Li7, Na23, and H1 (in the ammonia) were observed at 50 kc/sec in fields of 30.3 gauss, 44.2 gauss, and 11.7 gauss, respectively, and the electron spin resonances were saturated with the corresponding applied frequencies of 84, 124, and 33 Mc/sec. The detailed predictions of Overhauser were confirmed as far as nuclear polarization is concerned, although other relaxation processes in Li reduce the polarization, and the difficulty in completely saturating the metallic Na electron resonance leads to a partial effect. Only in fairly concentrated solutions of Na in ammonia was a substantially complete effect observed in which the proton nuclear polarization increased by the ratio of the electron gyromagnetic ratio to the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio. The proton line widths in the Na-ammonia solutions further verify the theory of Kaplan and Kittel. © 1956 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The rapid development of batteries, especially lithium-ion batteries, has dramatically changed our daily lives. From portable electronics to electric vehicles and smart grids, batteries are extensively used in many fields and are difficult to be replaced in terms of their excellent energy and power densities. The advancement of battery technology requires the thorough understanding of electrochemical reaction mechanisms, which strongly depends on the collaboration of researchers from different fields. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy includes the important techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and the former is suitable for studying light elements commonly found in batteries including Li, Na, P and O, while the latter is suitable for studying heavier transition metals such as Co, Mn, Fe and V. In addition, NMR and EPR are capable of quantitatively analysis in a nondestructive manner regardless of sample crystallinity. Hence, NMR and EPR spectroscopies have allowed for significant research progress and have become increasingly important for battery research over the past three decades. Herein, we will provide our perspective of magnetic resonance methods and first summarize the main interactions and the Hamiltonian forms of solid-state NMR and EPR (dipole-dipole interaction, electric quadrupole interaction, chemical shift, and hyperfine interaction). Subsequently, we summarize the important and frequently-used methods of solid-state NMR and EPR spectroscopies and introduce their representative applications in metal ion battery research (mainly lithium-and sodium-ion batteries). Specifically, we introduce the basic principles and representative applications of (i) MQMAS (multiple-quantum magic angle spinning), (ii) pjMATPASS (MAT = magic-angle turning, PASS = phase-adjusted sideband separation, and pj = projection), (iii) WURST-CPMG (WURST = wide band uniform rate smooth truncation, CPMG = Carr-Purcell Meiboom-Gil), (iv) 2D homonuclear correlation and exchange (2D EXSY), (v) 2D homonuclear correlation based on dipole coupling (i.e. RFDR), (vi) perpendicular mode EPR, (vii) parallel mode EPR, (viii) in situ NMR, and (ix) in situ EPR. In addition, we briefly introduce representative applications of 2D heteronuclear correlation (i.e. CP-HETCOR), pulsed field gradient NMR, spin-lattice relaxation (SLR), spin alignment echo (SAE), DFT calculations, and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Previous reviews regarding the application of magnetic resonance technology in battery research are almost all reported in terms of the classification of battery materials. In other words, they are written from the perspective of applications in cathode, anode, and electrolyte research. Herein, we summarize from the perspective of solid-state NMR and EPR methods, which may be beneficial for the readers to fully understand the value of these important technologies. We believe this review can serve as a guide to solve challenges related to using solid-state NMR and EPR spectroscopies in battery research.},

The battery contains a LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) spinel cathode, which is a material whose magnetic interactions are well understood. The evolution of the EPR signal in combination with electrochemical measurements shows the impact of Mn3+ on the Li+ motion inside the spinel. Moreover, state of charge dependent linewidth variations confirm the formation of a solid solution for slow cycling, which is taken over by mixed models of solid solution and two-phase formation for fast cycling due to kinetic restrictions and overpotentials. Long-term measurements for 480 h showed the stability of the investigated LNMO, but also small amounts of cathode degradation products became visible. The results point out how local, exchange mediated magnetic interactions in cathode materials are linked with battery performance and can be used for material characterization.},

   abstract = {The fast-growing demand for safe energy storages with high power and energy density drives the continuous improvement of rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs). In situ characterization is a potential way to understand the mechanism (metaphases, diffusion, kinetics, inhomogeneity etc.) of battery under operation conditions. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR) is very sensitive to the local environment of1H,6,7Li，11B，13C,17O,19F,23Na, and31P isotopes, which are widely used in battery materials, regardless of their ordering degree. In addition to providing well-resolved spectra obtained under fast magic angle spinning (MAS), NMR can effectively serve as a non-invasive tool to capture the evolution of electrodes/electrolyte upon charge/discharge electrochemical cycling. Subsequently, in situ NMR and imaging (MRI) have been developed for extending toward temporal and spatial dimensions in working batteries. Complementarily, highly sensitive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and imaging (EPRI) have been employed to track and map the redox of transition metals and oxygen species (O2n−) within electrodes. The insights gained from in situ NMR/EPR and their imaging can serve as a guide for the structural design of energy storage materials and the fabrication of batteries with optimized performance. As such, this review summarizes the applications of both NMR and EPR in the field of battery community. In particular, we first introduce the combination of fast magic angle spinning and phase-adjusted sideband separation (pjMATPASS) to obtain highly resolved spectra for extreme broad signal mediated by unpaired electrons, which is usually found in battery materials, as well as isotope-oriented NMR to determine the Li pathway in the composite electrolyte by the aid of6Li replacing7Li in their transport pathway. Secondly, we introduce the combination of NMR/MRI measurement while battery under electrochemical cycling by (1) briefly summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of home-made cells (coin cell, bag cell, and cylindrical cell) developed for in situ NMR study; (2) using different isotopes for conducting in situ NMR on batteries:7Li,23Na, and31P spectra; and (3) performing in situ MRI on electrolytes and electrodes with and without chemical shift information (CSI, S-ISIS, and stray-field MRI). Furthermore, in situ EPR determines and quantifies the evolution of active Li microstructure, transition metals, and oxygen species together with in situ EPRI mapping of the concentration of the paramagnetic center within a functioning battery. Finally, we point out the limitations and perspective of in situ NMR and EPR for cycling batteries in real-time. This review will provide illuminating insights on the magnetic technologies in the battery community and pave a way for carrying out NMR/EPR on functional materials.},

The EPR results reveal the P3HT radical cation as the only paramagnetic species in BCF-doped P3HT films and show evidence for increased mobility of the detected spins at high doping concentrations as well as formation of antiferromagnetically coupled spin pairs leading to decreased spin concentrations at low temperatures. The EPR signature for F4TCNQ-doped P3HT is found to be determined by spin exchange between P3HT radical cations and F4TCNQ radical anions. Results from continuous-wave and pulse EPR measurements suggest the presence of the unpaired spin on P3HT in a multitude of environments, ranging from free P3HT radical cations with similar properties to those observed in BCF-doped P3HT, to pairs of dipolar and exchange-coupled spins on P3HT and the dopant anion. Characterisation of the proton hyperfine interactions by ENDOR allowed quantification of the extent of spin delocalisation and revealed reduced delocalisation in the F4TCNQ-doped P3HT films.},

Here we apply a laboratory-based operando optical scattering microscopy method to study micrometre-sized rod-like particles of the anode material Nb14W3O44 during high-rate cycling. We directly visualize elongation of the particles, which, by comparison with ensemble X-ray diffraction, allows us to determine changes in the state of charge of individual particles. A continuous change in scattering intensity with state of charge enables the observation of non-equilibrium kinetic phase separations within individual particles. Phase field modelling (informed by pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance and electrochemical experiments) supports the kinetic origin of this separation, which arises from the state-of-charge dependence of the Li-ion diffusion coefficient. The non-equilibrium phase separations lead to particle cracking at high rates of delithiation, particularly in longer particles, with some of the resulting fragments becoming electrically disconnected on subsequent cycling. These results demonstrate the power of optical scattering microscopy to track rapid non-equilibrium processes that would be inaccessible with established characterization techniques.},

This article reports on the development of a versatile on-substrate electrode setup for spectroelectrochemical Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) measurements on redox conductive polymers for ORBs. Quantitative in operando EPR experiments performed on electrochemical cells with a di-TEMPO Ni-Salen polymer as active electrode material demonstrate a strong decrease in the number of paramagnetic centers upon oxidizing the film. The distinct EPR signatures of the TEMPO-containing polymer and its fragments in different molecular environments are used to study its degradation upon repeated cycling. A comparison between the number of EPR-active sites and the number of electrochemically active charges, as measured by cyclic voltammetry, provides information on the nature of the degradation process. Low-temperature ex situ pulse EPR measurements on the oxidized polymer film reveal the spectrum of dilute nitroxide species, which may be associated with electrochemically inactive islands. These experiments pave the way for advanced EPR techniques for accurately determining distances between adjacent paramagnetic centers and thus for identifying performance-limiting loss mechanisms, which can eventually help develop strategies for making ORBs powerful contenders on the path towards sustainable electrochemical power sources.},

   abstract = {By combining a viologen unit and a 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO) radical in one single combi-molecule, an artificial bipolar redox-active material, 1-(4-(((1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)oxy)carbonyl)benzyl)-1′-methyl-[4,4′-bipyridine]-1,1′-diium-chloride (VIOTEMP), was created that can serve as both the anode (−0.49 V) and cathode (0.67 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in a water-based redox-flow battery. While it mimics the redox states of flow battery metals like vanadium, the novel aqueous electrolyte does not require strongly acidic media and is best operated at pH 4. The electrochemical properties of VIOTEMP were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry, rotating disc electrode experiments, and spectroelectrochemical methods. A redox-flow battery was built and the suitability of the material for both electrodes was demonstrated through a polarity-inversion experiment. Thus, an organic aqueous electrolyte system being safe in case of cross contamination is presented.},

   abstract = {Redox‐active nitroxyl‐containing polymers are promising candidates as possible replacements for inorganic based energy storage materials, due to their high energy density and fast redox kinetics. One challenge towards the such system implementation is the insufficient electrical conductivity, impeding the charge collection even with highly conductive additives. Herein the first implementation of a polymeric bis(salicylideniminato) nickel (NiSalen) conductive backbone as an active charge‐collecting wire is reported. It serves as a charge collector for nitroxyl pendants and support the redox capacity of the material simultaneously. This novel polymer exhibits a specific capacity of up to 91.5 mAh g ‐1 , retains 87% of its theoretical capacity at 800 C and more than 30% as high as 3000C (66% capacity retention after 2000 cycles). The properties of the new material upon operation was studied by means of operando electrochemical methods, UV‐Vis and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.},

   abstract = {Intrinsically conductive polymer poly(N,N′-bis(3-methoxysalicylidene)ethylenediamine nickel(II)) (poly[Ni(CH3Osalen)]:PSS) has been synthesized by electrochemical polymerization from the [Ni(CH3Osalen)] solution containing tetrabutylammonium poly(styrenesulfonate) (TBAPSS). Cyclic voltammetry and in situ EQCM data demonstrated that electrochemical properties of poly[Ni(CH3Osalen)]:PSS are highly dependent on the nature of electrolyte solutions. A wider range of electrochemical activity, higher values of conductance and binary diffusion coefficient in TBAPSS solution are observed than in LiClO4, but the capacity values of films are higher in LiClO4 solution. The introduction of PSS− polyanion during synthesis of polymer film induced cationic mode of charge transport for poly[Ni(CH3Osalen)]. This type of PSS− doped polymers can be used as ion-exchange membranes. The combined electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and in situ conductance measurements on interdigitated electrodes were analyzed using the model concepts of Matthias and Haas, and Einstein relation. This novel approach allowed separating the diffusion coefficient into its ionic and electronic constituents. The ionic diffusion was found to be the limiting factor. Strong association of lithium cation with both the PSS− polyanion and methoxy-groups may be the cause of lower values of diffusion coefficients in LiClO4 solutions. The proposed model is suitable for further studies of similar systems.},
