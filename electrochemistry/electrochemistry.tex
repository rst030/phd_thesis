Necessary electrochemical characterization techniques are described. Preparation of electrochemically active organic cathode films with electro-polymerization is described, preparation of spectroscopic samples is described. A general charge transport model for a disordered electro-active conjugated polymer is reviewed.

\section{Rechargeable Electrochemical Cells}
Two opposite electric charges separated from each other can store energy in an electrostatic field. It is possible to accumulate many charges on the plates of a capacitor and store some energy~\cite{He_2022}, but due to the technological difficulties, electrochemical cells are commonly used instead~\cite{Figgener_2020}. An electrochemical cell is an energy storage device and a power source that undergoes a chemical reaction to transfer some electric charge from one of its components to another through an external circuit.

\end{figure}


A simple electrochemical cell consists of three elements: two spatially separated materials called electrodes, and a solution of mobile ions between them called electrolyte. The two electrodes have different work functions, or, chemically speaking, reduction-oxidation (redox) potentials. The potential difference between the two electrodes is called the open-circuit potential of the cell, $V_{OC}$. When the electrodes are connected through an external circuit, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~a), the charge flows from one electrode to another through the circuit and the ions in the electrolyte rearrange to maintain charge balance~\cite{muench2016_chemrev}. While the cell delivers the electric current to the circuit, a chemical reaction is happening on its electrodes: the positively charged electrode, called cathode, is being reduced, obtaining electrons from the negatively charged anode through the external circuit. At the same time, the anode loses electrons and is being oxidized. If the electrodes can undergo a reversible redox reaction, a current applied to the cell restores its charged state, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~b).\\

\subsection{Cell Electrodes}
The electrode of an ORB is made of a non-redox-active (metallic) lead and a layer of redox active (organic) molecules attached to the metal through an atomic bond~\cite{Boiziau1988} that allows for electrical conductivity. The charge transfer between the conductor and the redox active molecule in the cathode can be described in terms of the molecular orbitals of the cathode molecule and the Fermi energy of the electrode~\cite{DOM,Wu_2023,Boiziau1988}. The oxidation potential of a molecule correlates with the energy of its highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) ~\cite{Sworakowski2018,Wu_2023}. Consider an cathode made of a metallic lead and one redox active molecule attached to it. When the electric potential $V$ of the metallic lead is set lower than the HOMO of the cathode molecule, and the other end of the molecule is "grounded" with the electrolyte to the anode, an electron can be transferred from the cathode molecule to the lead. The cathode molecule loses an electron and acquires a positive charge. Its electronic level lowers below HOMO-1. The charge attracts a negative ion from the electrolyte. No charge transfer happens between the electrolyte ion and the charged molecule, but the movement of the ion allows the DC current to flow through the electrochemical cell, closing the electrical circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~a). In a cathode containing more than one layer of redox active molecules, together with the polymer-metal charge transfer, an intermolecular charge transfer has to take place in order to oxidize the may next molecular layer.\\ 
A symmetric reaction on the anode is reducing the anode molecule and changing its state from HOMO to LUMO. This redox reaction is the charging of an electrochemical cell. The opposite reaction is discharging. Upon discharging, the cathode is oxidized and the anode is reduced. Excessive charging and discharging may lead to an irreversible chemical reaction in the electrodes that is undesirable, so the potential of the cell has to be observed during its operation.\\

It is possible to study the redox reaction only at one electrode of the cell, e.g. the cathode, using a chemically inert second electrode. A cell with only one redox active electrode is called a half-cell. The studied electrode is called the working electrode (WE). The opposite electrode, called the reference electrode (RE), is made of a known material that maintains a constant composition and has a reproducible potential difference at the electrode-electrolyte interface called the standard potential. Any change in the potential difference between the WE and RE of the half-cell setup is therefore attributed to the processes in the WE only~\cite{Bard_book}.\\
However, when a half-cell is being charged and the current is flowing through the RE, a chemical reaction can take place at the RE, changing its composition and the standard potential that change the parameters of the half-cell~\cite{Bard_book,DOM}. For this reason, a three-electrode half-cell shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~c) is used for characterizing battery electrodes that are designed for significant charging currents.\\

In the three-electrode half-cell, the charging current is applied between the WE and a chemically inert counter electrode (CE). The oxidation of the WE is accompanied by the formation of a double layer of the electrolyte molecules at the surface of the CE. The electric potential of the WE is measured as a potential difference between the WE and the calibrated RE, inserted in the electrolyte close to the CE. The potential difference between WE and RE is measured with a high impedance voltmeter that ensures minimal charge flow through the RE. That is, RE does not undergo a chemical reaction during the charging of WE, its chemical environment does not change during the experiment and the measured potential corresponds to the potential of the WE. Due to the finite dimensions of the electrodes and the finite thickness of the double layer around the CE, the RE cannot be inserted at the position of the CE, so the measured potential has a constant offset as the electrolyte between the points where WE, CE and CE are inserted, acts as a voltage divider~\cite{Bard_book}.\\

\subsection{Reference Electrode}
To measure the potential $E$ of the cell electrode, a calibrated, inert electrode is inserted to the cell and its potential is chosen as $E=0$. A general RE is the standard hydrogen electrode (Pt/H$_2$/H$^+$), or SHE. The main difference between the various RE is their operation range and a constant potential shift with respect to the SHE depending on the workfunction of the RE material. The couple Ag/AgNO$_3$ is commonly used in electrochemistry~\cite{Bard_book}. It exhibits a shift of 0.7991~V vs. SHE. For the couple Ag/AgCl, the shift is 0.2223~V against SHE~\cite{Bard_book,DOM}, although these values can only be used if the electrode configuration is strictly equivalent to the one used for determining them. In other cases, like in the case with a thin electrolyte layer in the modified sample tube, the exact shifts of the RE might differ~\cite{DOM}.\\

The Ag/AgCl reference (RE) electrode for the EPR-compatible electrochemical cells described in ~\ref{sec:tube_cell} was formed by coating a layer of AgCl onto a 250~$\muup$m Ag wire galvanically from a 1~\textsc{m} aqueous solution of KCl. For that, the Ag wire and a Pt wire were connected as a cathode and an anode respectively to 10$\,$mL of the KCL solution and a DC potential of 500$\,$mV was applied for 7500$\,$s which resulted in a dark AgCl layer deposited onto the Ag cathode. In the beginning of the galvanic deposition, the current through the KCl solution was changing in a jumpy manner, that indicated the growth of the AgCl layer. The galvanic process was stopped after the current was stable for at least 300$\,$s.\\

\subsection{Electrolyte}
\begin{figure}[h]
\center
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/materials/electrolytes.pdf}
	\caption{ETFNBF4 in ACN and PC. TMIMTFSI in PVDF.}
	\label{fig:electrolytes}
\end{figure}

Electrolyte is an ionic conductor~\cite{Bard_book} - an electrically conductive solution of oppositely charged ions that are typically products of dissociation of the corresponding salts. The dissociation of a salt in a solvent implies that the solvent has high enough dielectric constant $\varepsilon$ to polarize the salt molecule and to separate it into a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion) by creating solvation shells around them. High mobility of the electrolyte ions is needed for the efficient ion diffusion into the battery electrodes, so that the redox reaction can take place along the entire surface of the electrode material that is soaked into the electrolyte. The ionic mobility also influences the Ohmic losses and polarization of electric double layers, governing, together with the electronic properties of the electrodes, the power density of a battery~\cite{Neueder2014}.\\

\par{}
Tetraetylammonium tetrofluoroborate (Et$_4$NBF$_4$, Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes}~a) is a crystalline salt that dissociates into a EtF$_4$N$^-$ cation and a BF$_4^-$ anion in polar solvents such as Acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN, Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes},b) and Propylene Carbonate (C$_4$H$_6$O$_3$, Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes},c). Et$_4$NBF$_4$ is a small molecule with a relatively high dissociation energy, so the solvents have high dielectric constants ($\varepsilon\approx40$ for Acetonitrile and $\varepsilon\approx64$ for Propylene Carbonate). Propylene Carbonate has higher density than Acetonitrile, has higher viscosity and is less volatile. A 100~mM solution of Et$_4$NBF$_4$ in Acetonitrile or in Propylene Carbonate ensures sufficient ionic transport for the organic electrochemical cells described later in this section.

\subsubsection{Polymer-based Gel Electrolyte}
The use of ionic liquids and the suitable polymer matrix allows for fabrication solid-state electrolytes that are used for making organic electrochemical neurons~\cite{Harikesh2022} and solid-state Li batteries~\cite{Pang2021}. PVDF (Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes}~e) was used as a polymer matrix. TMIMTFSI (Figure~\ref{fig:electrolytes}~d) was the ionic liquid. The polymer grains were dissolved in Chloroform at 80~$^{\deg}$C and the ionic liquid was mixed in at a ratio $1:4:20$ (polymer : ionic liquid : solvent). The polymer electrolyte was used to manufacture an all-polymer organic radical battery described later in this section.


\subsection{Characteristics of Rechargeable Batteries}
Depending on the redox potentials of the used electrodes, the output voltage of a cell ($V_{OC}$) ranges between 0 and 5~V~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater}. Most applications require higher voltages, so multiple cells are connected in series to form a battery.%For a commercial Li-polymer cell, the safe operating limits are $2.8$~V~$<V_{OC}<4.2$~V.\\

\paragraph{Energy and power density, C-rate and State Of Charge}
The capacity of a battery $C$ is measured in mAh. It is the maximal electric charge that can be stored in it. Different electrode materials can store different amounts of charge depending on their chemical structure and macroscopic structure. Due to the unavoidable losses of charge caused by the finite shunting resistance between the battery electrodes, one distinguishes between the charging capacity and the discharging capacity. The capacity of 1~g of an electro-active material is its gravimetric capacity, it is measured in mAhg$^{-1}$. The volumetric capacity is the corresponding value with respect to the volume of the material that is measured in mAhl$^{-1}$. The energy stored in a battery is a product of its capacity and its voltage. The ratio of the stored energy to the volume of the battery is its energy density. The energy density of a battery depends on the capacity of the electrodes and the potential difference between the electrodes~\cite{Liu2016}. The fraction of charge left in a cell with respect to the full charge that can be stored in that cell in percent is called the state of charge or SoC. The SoC of a fully charged battery is 100\%.\\
\par
A battery is typically charged with a constant DC current. The magnitude of the charging (or discharging) current relative to the battery capacity determines the rate at which a battery is charged (or discharged). The charging rate, or C-rate is the charge or discharge current in Amps divided by the cell capacity in Ampere-hours. For a modern rechargeable Li-polymer battery a safe charging C-rate cannot exceed 1~C~\cite{Zhang2022}. That means, the charging time for a Li-polymer battery cannot be shorter than 1 hour. The discharge rate of the same battery, however, can be as high as 100~C that corresponds to a discharge current larger than the charging current by a factor of 100. The power that a battery can deliver depends on its maximal C rate and equals to the product of its short-circuit current and its voltage. The organic radical batteries can have charging and discharging C rates close to 3000~C and gravimetric discharge capacities upto 111~mAhg$^{-1}$~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,friebe2017_topcurrchem,Zens2022,Vereshchagin2022,Kulikov2023,Tarascon2001}. While the capacities of the organic electrode materials are smaller than for the Li metal electrodes (3850 mAh$g^{-1}$), the organic electrode materials allow for much higher C rates that already exceed the C rate of the Li cells by orders of magnitude~\cite{C_rates_of_lipos}.

\paragraph{State Of Health}
The capacity of a battery may decrease upon repeated charge-discharge cycling, especially at high C rates~\cite{Guan2018,Ouyang2020}, over-discharge~\cite{Ma2020} and extreme environmental conditions~\cite{Zhang2022}. The ratio of the maximum battery charge to its rated as-manufactured capacity expressed in percent is called the battery state of health (SoH). SoH is a measure of the remaining life time of a battery. The decrease in SoH indicates the intensified irreversible processes that take place in an electrochemical cell, such as a physical damage~\cite{Fu_2015}, degradation of the electrode material~\cite{Ma2020,Kulikov2022}, side reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface~\cite{Tarascon2001}, or decomposition of the electrolyte~\cite{Fang_2021}. A damaged cell, especially that can store significant amount of charge, represents a major hazard~\cite{Ma2020}. Accurate measurements of SoH can prevent hazardous battery malfunctions such as explosions.

\section{Electrochemical Instrumentation}
\subsection{Cyclic Voltammogram}
The complete electrochemical behavior of a redox active molecular system can be obtained with a series of transient current responses to potentials, applied step-wise to the electrochemical cell containing the system. However for a basic electrochemical characterization a current response during a linearly swept potential is sufficient~\cite{Bard_book}. During the linear-potential-sweep chronoamperometry, or linear sweep voltammetry, the potential $E$ applied to the electrochemical cell is swept in a linear manner between the values $E_{min}$ and $E_{max}$, upwards and downwards, with a rate $v~($mVs$^{-1})$: $E(t) = E_0\pm vt$. During the sweep, the current is recorded as a function of the applied potential as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}~a). The resulting plot $i(E)$ is the cyclic voltammogram (CV). The upward potential sweep corresponds to the anodic, or charging branch of the CV and the downward sweep corresponds to the cathodic, or discharge branch. A CV of a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a pDiTBuS electro-active polymer film on the WE is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}~b). When $E$ reaches the oxidation potential of the working electrode, charge transfer happens and the current through the cell increases. This corresponds to the oxidation peak in the cathodic branch. The width of the peak is determined by the temperature of the cell and the number of electrons $n$ transferred in a single oxidation reaction ($n=2$ for poly-di-TEMPO-Salen, the redox conductive polymer discribed in Section~\ref{sec:ORB_materials}). The negative current peak in the anodic branch of the CV curve corresponds to the reduction of the WE. The difference between the potentials of the oxidation and reduction peaks arises because of the finite electric capacity of the electro-active film and a finite voltage sweep rate. For higher sweep rates the difference in peak potentials is higher, as the scan rate approaches the RC time constant of the cell.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/CV_pDiTBuS.pdf}
	\caption{a): Electrochemical setup for measuring a cyclic voltammogram. b): Linear voltage sweep at a 50~mVs$^{1}$ rate. c) Cyclic voltammogram of an electro-active polymer cathode film. Oxidation and reduction of the charge-bearing fragments of the film corresponds to the $A$ and $A^\prime$ redox peaks, respectively. Oxidation and reduction of the conductive polymer backbone of the film corresponds to peaks $B$ and $B^\prime$. The standard oxidation potential of the charge-bearing fragments, $E_{1/2}^A$, lies close to the standard oxidation potential of the backbone, $E_{1/2}^B$.}
	\label{fig:CV_DiTBuS}
\end{figure}

The area under the anodic branch can be used to calculate the charge that was transferred from the WE upon its reduction from the fully oxidized state. The applied voltage is swept at a known rate, so the anodic branch $i(E)$ can be plotted vs. time $i(t)$, hence the transferred charge equals to the integral under the curve: $q = \int_{E_{max}}^{E_{min}}i(t)dt$. By knowing the $q$ and considering the corresponding chemical reaction (how many electrons are transferred for one molecule) one gets the amount of substance in the electrode $\nu=qF$~[mol] and the number of electrochemically active molecules $N_{echem}=\nu N_A$ with $F=9.46853321233100184\times10^4$~C$\times$mol$^{-1}$ for the Faraday constant and $N_A=6.02214076\times10^{23}$~mol$^{-1}$ for the Avogadro constant~\cite{NIST}. Given the molecular weight $M$, the total mass of the electrochemically active molecules of the film can be calculated, and with the information on the density of the film its dimensions can be estimated. However as demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:quantitative_EPR} and in Refs.~\cite{Vereshchagin2022,Kulikov2022,Kulikov2023}, the number of electrochemically active molecules in a polymer cathode film can be much lower than the total number of molecules in it.  

\subsection{Charge-Discharge Cycling}
\label{sec:echem_charging}

	\label{fig:GCD}
\end{figure}

A constant-current characterization technique called galvanostatic potentiometry~\cite{Bard_book} can be used in combination with the cyclic voltammetry to study the redox behavior of the electrochemical system quantitatively. The setup for galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~a). The cell is excited with a DC current as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~b) and the potential of the cell is measured as a function of time, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c). Upon positive (charging) current, the working electrode of the cell is oxidized. The voltage required to provide the charging current gradually increases, resulting a galvanostatic charging curve shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c). The shape of the charging curve can be approximated by considering two major effects: the Faradic current and the displacement current~\cite{Bard_book}. The Faradic current is caused by the oxidation of the redox active species in the WE. It defines the plateau regions in the middle of the charging and discharging curves. The displacement current is the result of the charging of a double layer around the WE and CE. It explains the capacitor-like response of the charging and discharging curves at their ends~\cite{Bard_book}. In this regard the electrochemical cell with only one redox active can be treated as a pseudocapacitor~\cite{He_2022,Vereshchagin2022}. When all redox active species of the WE are oxidized, the voltage required for providing the charging current steeply increases, that is seen in the end of the charging curves in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c) and ~\ref{fig:GCD_DiTBuS}. Eventually, upon charging, the potential of the cell grows beyond the oxidation peak of the WE, according to the cyclic voltammogram (Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}). Then the charging is stopped and the transferred charge is calculated from the charging time. The same strategy is applied for the discharging curve to determine the discharging capacity of the cell. The reproducibility of the charge-discharge curve indicates the stability of the electrochemical cell. SoH of the cell can be estimated by observing the decrease in the period of the charge-discharge curve.

\section{Redox Conductive Polymers}

Redox active macromolecules or polymers~\cite{Staudinger_1920} are known since 1940s due to the works of Lauth and Cassidy~\cite{Cassidy_1949} on electron exchange polymers. After the discovery of the conductivity of polyacetylene by Shirakawa, Heeger and McDiarmid in 1977~\cite{Shirakawa_1977}, organic semiconducting polymers with sufficient charge carrier mobilities ($\muup>1~$cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) were synthesized~\cite{Hu2021}, and the field of organic electronics had emerged~\cite{heeger_polymers,Casado_2021_book}. Electron and hole mobilities in modern organic semiconductors have reached the values as high as $\muup>10~$cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$~\cite{Hu2021} and, theoretically, can be above $\muup>100~$cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ for organic molecular co-crystals~\cite{Zhu2012}, which enables efficient charge transport in fast-switching organic electronic circuits. Organic solar cells~\cite{Lee_1993}, organic field effect transistors~\cite{Koezuka_1987,Yan2009}, e-papers~\cite{Hu2021} and organic electrochemical neurons~\cite{Harikesh2022} contain conjugated polymers that have electrical properties of semiconductors, yet can be easily printed in form of thin flexible films without using high temperatures, can be bio-integrated and undergo an environmentally friendly recycling~\cite{nishide_2009}. A combination of conductive polymers with charge-bearing organic radicals~\cite{IWASA2007} has formed the class of redox conductive polymers~\cite{Casado_2021_book} and lead to the concept of an organic radical battery~\cite{Rohland_2021,nishide2004_electact,nakahara2002_cpl,Xie2021} - the last missing component needed for making an electronic device fully organic.\\

\subsection{Semiconducting Polymers}
\par
The key for polymer conductivity is the $\pi$ - conjugated network, a system of overlapping $\pi$ orbitals of carbon in a chain of alternating single and double carbon-carbon bonds that allows charge delocalization along the polymer backbone~\cite{heeger_polymers,Koehler_book,Casado_2021_book}. An example of a $\pi$ conjugated network is polyacetylene shown in Figure~\ref{fig:homo-lumo}. Polyacetylene exhibits a band structure in the electron energy levels (between $\pi$ and $\pi^\star$ orbitals) and represents a molecular semiconductor.\\
\par
Consider a simple organic molecule, ethylene, in Figure \ref{fig:ethylene}. It contains two carbon atoms and four hydrogens. Each carbon atom has six electrons. The four unpaired electrons of carbon - one at the $2s$ orbital and three at the $2p$ orbital - interact to form two $sp^2$- hybridized orbitals and one unhybridized $p_z$ orbital, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pi-bond}. 

\begin{figure} [h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.85\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/ethylene.png}
\caption{Ethylene molecule with $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bonds \cite{Koehler_book}.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\subfloat[Formation of a conductive $p_z$ orbital in a conjugated array of carbon atoms. \label{fig:pi-bond}]{

\caption{Formation of a band gap in a conjugated polymer. Figures adapted from~\cite{cambridge}.}
	  \label{fig:conjugation}
\end{figure}

The hybridized $sp^2$ orbitals form $\sigma$ bonds between adjacent carbon atoms that keep the carbon atoms together in the molecule. The remaining $p_z$ orbitals interact with each other and form a $\pi$ bond so that $p_z$ electrons are shared between the carbon atoms. The interaction between $p_z$ orbitals results in two molecular orbitals, the bonding ($\pi$) and the antibonding ($\pi^*$) orbitals. A $\pi$ orbital is described by a symmetric wavefunction and $\pi^*$ orbital is described by an antisymmetric wavefunction. A $\pi$ orbital has a lower energy than $\pi^*$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:homo-lumo}. The symmetric $\pi$ orbital is more energetically favorable, so the electrons occupy it at the equilibrium. Because of that, the $\pi$ orbital is called the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and $\pi^*$ is the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO). There is a forbidden energy zone between HOMO and LUMO which is equivalent to a bandgap of a semiconductor. In a longer molecule, the $\pi$/$\pi^*$ states are delocalized over many carbon atoms. This is known as conjugation and the number of conjugated atoms determine the conjugation length.\\
\par As conjugation length increases, the HOMO and LUMO levels for each pair of carbon atoms in the molecule become slightly different. In a polymer with a very large conjugation length, many energy levels around HOMO and LUMO overlap which forms energy bands, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:conjugation}~\cite{Koehler_book,cambridge}. At a finite temperature, there is a non-zero population of electrons above the LUMO level which allows them to move freely along the chain of overlapping $p_z$ orbitals and makes conjugated polymers conductive~\cite{heeger_polymers}.\\

\par Even though conjugated polymers have band-like energy structure and a bandgap, their charge-transport properties are different from crystalline semiconductors. Real polymer chains have finite lengths that brings disorder to an organic semiconductor (Figure \ref{fig:hopping}~a). The disorder causes localization of electronic wave functions that is known as charge carrier trapping and hinders the electrical transport in semiconductors~\cite{Yi2016,Meier2013}, so when an external electric field is applied, a charge needs additional energy to hop from one localized state to another for electric current to flow (Figure \ref{fig:hopping}~b). In Figure \ref{fig:hopping}~c) it is shown how a charge moves through a disordered organic semiconductor choosing the optimal path in both energy and space domains. This mode of charge transport is referred to as the hopping transport~\cite{Tessler2009}.\\

\begin{figure} [h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/hopping.png}
\caption{Transport of charge through localized energy sites distributed both in space (a) and in energy (b). The line describes a possible path that a charge carrier takes while hopping through a conjugated polymer under an external electric field. The trajectory is affected by the energy distribution (c). The picture is taken from Ref.~\cite{Tessler2009}.}
\label{fig:hopping}
\end{figure}

Redox conductive polymers (RCP), besides being conductive, are able to store a charge. Typically, a RCP has a large concentration of charge bearing fragments that are interconnected by the polymer backbone~\cite{Casado_2021_book}. Storage of charge implies that the stored charge carriers are localized and cannot freely move within the polymer, unless the appropriate electric field is applied to release them to the conjugated network. Therefore the charge bearing fragments of an RCP can be viewed as charge carrier traps. The high concentration of the charge carrier traps in an RCP makes neither the hopping-charge transport model~\cite{Sato2018}, nor the band-like transport model~\cite{Koehler_book} applicable to describe the electric transport in these materials.

\subsection{Charge Transport Model for Redox Conductive Polymers}  
The transfer of charge between the metallic substrate of the electrode and the surface-bound molecules of the electrode can be described in terms of the electrode workfunction, applied potential, electrolyte dynamics and the LUMO level of the electrode molecule~\cite{Bard_book}. 
On the contrary, the transfer of charge between the molecules inside the volume of the electrode is a complex process that involves hopping and time-dependent delocalization of the charge carriers in the percolated network of the porous electrode material under a changing electrostatic field that is dependent on the state of charge of the electrode, as well as on the diffusion of the electrolyte ions. The molecular systems for electrochemical charge storage are inherently disordered materials and the electric performance of a film containing those molecules is strongly dependent on the deposition method, as well as on the molecular structure~\cite{Xie2021,Zhang2018}. The particular charge transport models have been developed that are applicable to certain classes of polymers.  The charge transfer between the radicals in non-conductive redox polymers is described with the diffusion cooperation model that involves charge hopping between the charge bearing fragments as well as their Brownian motion~\cite{Sato2018}.

 \ik{(look at that chapter in the polymer book + last talk at FU and show what was done)}, but so far there has not been a unified physical model that would describe the charge transport phenomena in redox-conductive polymer films.\\

The charge transfer within the redox-conductive polymer electrode governs the speed, reversibility, released by-products and physical conditions of the redox reaction in an organic electrochemical cell, that are the key factors that define the charging rate, cycling stability, self-discharge rate and the area of application of ORBs. This type of redox reaction had been of great interest for the field of energy storage, particularly, electrochemistry, where numerous characterization techniques have been developed to optimize the architecture of electrochemical power sources. In the following chapters a spectroelectrochemical analysis of organic redox-conductive polymers containing nitroxyl radicals is presented using the toolbox of the electron spin resonance spectroscopy.\\

\section{Organic Radical Battery}

Batteries based on RCPs containing stable radical moieties as high-capacitance groups represent a promising class of future electrochemical power sources - organic radical batteries (ORB)~\cite{nakahara2002_cpl, nishide2004_electact,xie2021_mathoriz,Rohland_2021}. ORB combine the advantages of high-power supercapacitors, namely high discharge rates, and the high energy density of conventional lithium-ion technology. In contrast to the lithium-ion battery, the charging of an organic battery does not involve intercalation of metal ions into the electrodes. This reduces the structural change of the electrode upon repeated recharging which allows for a longer cycle life of an ORB. The semi-conducting nature of organic electrodes reduces the Joule heating during the battery operation, and this allows for higher charge/discharge rates. The amorphous and swollen structure of organic electrodes allows the electrolyte ions to diffuse faster into the electrode, which also increases the charge/discharge rate~\cite{nishide_2009}. A further beneficial property of organic materials over traditional inorganic materials is their availability and the low cost of the starting materials for the synthesis of the target polymers in conjunction with good mechanical properties~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater, muench2016_chemrev, friebe2017_topcurrchem}. The large knowledge base on polymer processing allows for inkjet printing, roll-to-roll processing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques for making low-cost, flexible and light-weight integrated devices, including flexible plastic batteries~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater,nishide_2009}. 

\subsection{Organic Electrode Materials}
\label{sec:ORB_materials}
ORB based on redox polymers containing stable radicals~\cite{nakahara2002_cpl} have been shown to compete with or even outperform  conventional Li based batteries in terms of power densities~\cite{IWASA2007} with the additional benefit of being free from rare precursors, inheriting mechanical properties of plastics and electrical properties of semiconductors~\cite{friebe2017_topcurrchem,Casado2021,Goujon2021}. Advanced molecular design techniques allow for tuning of the electrochemical properties of the redox polymers~\cite{Janoschka2017}, that brings in a rich variety of organic energy storage materials~\cite{Xie2021,Vereshchagin2022,Janoschka2017a} and creates a large room for their optimization.

\subsection{TEMPO}
TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:molecules}~a) is a small molecule and a stable radical that can undergo a fast and reversible redox reaction between TEMPO$^\bullet$ and TEMPO$^+$~\cite{Wang2019}, with an electron self-exchange rate constant of $k_{ex}\approx10^{6-8}$ M$^{-1}$~s$^{-1}$~\cite{Chatgilialoglu2012}. TEMPO is an inexpensive organic compound~\cite{Vereshchagin2022} produced from acetone with liquid ammonia, hydrazine and peroxide~\cite{Casado_2021_book}. TEMPO radicals are widely used as spin labels in the studies of biological systems with electron spin resonance~\cite{Bordignon2017}, because the unpaired electron of TEMPO$^\bullet$ has a well defined spectral signature that changes when the local environment of a TEMPO fragment changes. TEMPOL is a TEMPO with an OH group. It is soluble in many organic solvents and forms crystals. Solutions of TEMPOL with various concentrations can be used for the reference spectroscopic measurements, as by varying the concentration the strength of inter-spin interactions between the neighboring radicals can be adjusted.

\end{figure}



Redox conductive conjugated polymers containing TEMPO redox groups, as pDiTBuS (poly-di-TEMPO-Butyl-Salen) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_1}, demonstrate particularly promising energy and power densities~\cite{Vereshchagin2020}. The pDiTBuS was designed as a cathode material: it is oxidized when the electrochemical cell containing this material is charged. A film of pDiTBuS comprises a high concentration of redox active stable nitroxyl radicals attached to a conjugated polymer backbone that interconnects them as a molecular wire. Such system can be viewed as a highly disordered molecular hole-transporting semiconductor (the poly-NiSalen backbone) that contains a large amount of hole traps (TEMPO groups) attached to it with butyl linkers. When the film is reduced (discharged), the TEMPO groups are in the radical state and act as unfilled traps. Upon oxidation (charging), the TEMPO fragments lose an unpaired electron and acquire a positive charge, so the traps are being filled with holes. The reversible redox reaction in the pDiTBuS film is demonstrated in a cyclic voltammogram shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}, c) and in the equal charging and discharging capacity of the film in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD_DiTBuS}, c).

\par
While active electrode materials with nitroxide radicals as redox-active groups are ideally suited for organic radical batteries (ORBs) that exhibit high power densities, the broad application of most nitroxide-based materials is limited by their moderate electrical properties. A promising route towards overcoming the conductivity problem is the use of polymers that combine radical-containing moieties and a conductive backbone. This strategy was successfully followed in a number of studies focusing on different polymers~\cite{oyaizu2015_polymerjournal, bahaceci2013_jpowersources, katsumata2006_mrc, xu2014_electact, aydin2015_jsoistatelect, schwartz2018_synthmet}. The standard redox potential of the NiSalen molecular backbone ($E_{1/2}^B$ in the middle of the peaks B and B$^\prime$ in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}) lay close to the standard redox potential of the attached nitroxide charge-bearing fragments ($E_{1/2}^A$ in the middle of the peaks A and A$^\prime$ in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}) - that ensures an efficient charge transport between the charge-bearing fragments and the conductive backbone and allows for very high charge and discharge rates up to 3000~C~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Kulikov2022}.

\subsection{PTMA}
A simple organic radical polymer containing TEMPO is poly-TEMPO-methacrylate) (PTMA, Figure~\ref{fig:molecules}~c). The polymer backbone of PTMA consists of single C-C bonds and therefore is not conductive, so the transport of charge in a PTMA film has to be mediated by adding conductive mesh such as activated carbon. When mixed with conductive carbon additive, PTMA has become a standard cathode material for ORBs and Li-ORBs, providing a discharge cell voltage of V$_{OC}=3.5$~V (with a Li anode) and a theoretical discharge capacity of $C_{theo}=111$~mAh/g~\cite{Daniel2023_Multimodal}. PTMA is soluble in acetonitrile (AN), chloroform (CF), tetrahydrofurane and dichlormethane. It is claimed to be insoluble in toluene, ethers, carbonates, and alcohols, however it becomes gel-like with some of these solvents~\cite{DOM}.

\subsection{NiSalen}
The molecular backbone of a redox conductive polymer has to conduct electric charge. A NiSalen molecule is a Schiff complex of Ni that has a conjugated path through it. The conductivity of NiSalen was measured. Upon oxidation of a polymeric NiSalen, the formation of positive polarons was observed in it with UV-Vis spectroscopy~\cite{Dmitrieva2018}, that suggests p-NiSalen is a p-type molecular semiconductor. p-NiSalen exhibits electrochemical capacity and can store up to two positive charges per monomer unit.


\subsection{Poly-Di-TEMPO-Salens}
Redox conductive conjugated polymers containing TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) redox groups, as pDiTS~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Kulikov2022} (poly-Di-Tempo-Salen) and pDiTBuS~\cite{Kulikov2023} (poly-di-TEMPO-Butyl-Salen) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:molecules} e) and f), demonstrate particularly promising energy and power densities with charging rates upto 3000~C and gravimetric capacity upto 91.5~mAh~g$^{-1}$ for pDiTS~\cite{Vereshchagin2020} and upto 75~mAh~g$^{-1}$ for pDiTBuS~\cite{Kulikov2023}. pDiTS and pDiTBuS have similar molecular structures, except for pDiTBuS has no oxygens in the linkers that connect the backbone to the TEMPO fragments, which has led to its higher electrochemical stability and a more efficient electro-polymerization, that allows for growing thicker films. pDiTS is a charge storage material that consists of TEMPO redox active molecular fragments~\cite{Vereshchagin2022,jeschke2012_annrevphyschem,Halbmair2016} interconnected by a redox conductive conjugated NiSalen backbone~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Dmitrieva2018}. DiTS and DiTBuS monomers were synthesized in the Levin group at the Saint-Petersburg State University.\\
pDiTS was designed as a cathode material: it is oxidized when the electrochemical cell containing this material is charged. A film of pDiTBuS comprises a high concentration of redox active stable nitroxyl radicals attached to a conjugated polymer backbone that interconnects them as a molecular wire. Such system may be viewed as a highly disordered molecular hole-transporting semiconductor (the poly-NiSalen backbone) that contains a large amount of hole traps (TEMPO groups) attached to it with butyl linkers. When the film is reduced (discharged), the TEMPO groups are in the radical state and act as unfilled traps. Upon oxidation (charging), the TEMPO fragments lose an unpaired electron and acquire a positive charge, so the traps are being filled with holes~\cite{Kulikov2023}.

The process of polymerization is connecting multiple monomer units of one sort to a continuous molecular chain. A polymerization of redox active molecules, such as NiSalen monomer fragnents, can be done electrochemically with the setup shown in Figure~\ref{fig:electropolymerization_reaction}. A three-electrode cell is made with a 10~mM solution of NiSalen in the electrolyte. By applying a positive voltage between the WE (Au) and the CE (Pt), NiSalen molecules are adsorbed to the surface of the We and oxidized. Oxidation of NiSalen leads to a formation of a positive radical in the ring of the NiSalen that can be seen as the opening of the ring, as shown in the diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:electropolymerization_reaction}. The oxidized, open ring attracts the next NiSalen molecule from the solution, then the positive radical is transferred from the ring to the attracted molecule through the conjugated network and the two molecules form a bond. The reaction repeats until the conductivity of the film allows for efficient transfer of the positive radical to its outer surface, so a pNiSalen film is grown on the WE surface~\cite{Apraksin2021,Vereshchagin2020}.\\ 
\par
The electrochemical polymerization of a TEMPO-Salen cannot be done in the same way as for pNiSalen because of the electrical screening effect of the charge-bearing TEMPO radicals that tend to charge together with NiSalen and form a Coulombic schield that repells the TEMPO-Salen fragments in the solution~\cite{Vereshchagin2020}. To discharge the TEMPO fragments, the growing film has to be periodically discharged, so a cycling voltage is applied to perform a cyclic polymerization of pDiTS and pDiTBuS films~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Kulikov2023}. The effect of charging is also pronounced in the polymerization of NiSalen films due to their charge-storing ability, so both pNiSalen and poly-TEMPO-Salen films are grown with cycling polymerization.\\

Fast And Capacious:\\
"Electrochemical polymerization of DiTS was studied by means of the EQCM technique on piezoelectric crystals coated with platinum using a linear voltage sweep. The CV of DiTS (Figure FAC2A) shows the paired peaks A and A' at 0.55 V and 0.47 V respectively, which correspond to charging and discharging of the nitroxyl fragments. An irreversible anodic peak B corresponds to oxidative coupling of the NiSalen fragments
of DiTS, which results in the polymer p-DiTS~\cite{Vereshchagin_2019,Koshika_2009}. The gradual
increase of the CV current and the electrode mass (Figure FAC2A) in the subsequent cycles indicates the course of the polymerization process. An unusual feature in the EQCM curves, recorded during the electropolymerization process, is that the mass growth at the electrode occurs predominantly at potentials below the peak A' (Figure FAC2A), which is in contradiction to previous reports on the deposition of a NiSalen-type polymer, where polymerization occurs at potentials above the oxidation peak of the monomeric NiSalen.[22]
The CV sweep boundaries were varied to establish the optimal conditions for the polymerization of DiTS. Only the
redox peaks of the TEMPO moieties in solution are observed on CV (Figure 2C, curve i) while sweeping in 0.40–0.75 V range without polymer formation. An extension of the anodic
boundary to 0.90 V (Figure FAC2C, curve ii) led to an increase in EQCM mass and CV current, which indicates the polymer growth on the electrode surface. Further extension of the anodic region of the CV range (Figure 2C, curve iv) did not improve the polymerization process, but led to a decrease of
the conductivity of the film due to overoxidation (Figure FACS4), highlighting 0.90 V as an optimal position of the anodic boundary. While polymerization is possible at higher potentials on the surface of a clean substrate, low conductivity of the overoxidized film is blocking further monomer oxidation on the
surface, leading to rapid decrease in monomer oxidation current (Figure S4 and Figure 2C, curve iv). When the cathodic boundary was set near the A/A’ pair and the CV was performed
between 0.35 V and 0.90 V (Figure FAC2C, curve iii), no polymerization occurred, emphasizing the crucial role of the charge-discharge of the nitroxyl fragments in the polymerization process.\\

The conventional mechanism for the chain growth of polymeric NiSalens is based on the formation of radical cation
species. Although the NiSalen-centered radical cations of DiTS
are formed on the peak B (Figure FAC2A), apparently the polymerization proceeds at a low rate in this area of potentials, compared to other NiSalen type complexes~\cite{Novozhilova_2009}. Based on the
obtained results, we assume that the positive charge density both on the monomer molecules and deposited polymer layers grow rapidly above the A (Figure FAC2A) peak potential due to simultaneous oxidation of the NiSalen core and two TEMPO fragments in one molecule. High charge density causes intermolecular coulombic repulsion, acting as a coulombic "shield", which hinders the coupling of radical cation species and prevents the chain growth. As soon as the potential has decreased to the A' (Figure FAC2A) peak on the negative scan of the CV (Figure S5C, point C), rapid polymer growth occurred due to the discharge of the p-DiTS film, which deactivates the
coulombic shield. The formation of the polymer proceeds until the shield recovers during the next CV cycle due to the oxidation of nitroxyl fragments. At this point, a sharp decrease in mass occurs due to the desorption of the monomeric DiTS molecules repelled by the charging coulombic shield. The scheme of this process is depicted in Figure FAC2B and a scheme of the polymer formation process in Figure FAC2D.\\ 

The mass growth for one deposition cycle is ca. 0.3 ug cm 2 both for 5 mV s 1 and 50 mV s 1 CVs. Polymer deposition is observed both at potentials higher than 0.8 V and lower than 0.4 V, and during low rate CV almost two thirds of the overall polymer mass is formed at potentials more positive than the potentials of the
A/A' peaks. On the contrary, at 50 mV/s only one third of the polymer is formed at potentials higher than 0.8 V. This indicates that the Coulombic shielding from oxidized TEMPO groups allows coupling between the radical cations of DiTS and the charged TEMPO groups, though at quite low rate. The
possibility of polymerization at both potential regions was confirmed by the experiment consisting of a series of
successive iterations of potentiostatic and potentiodynamic syntheses, as well as open-circuit rest periods (See SI and Figure FACS6 for further discussion)"

\section{Energy Diagram of a pDiTS Electrochemical Cell}
A connection between the electrochemistry and solid state physics.
The energy at which an electron in a material can be found with a 0.5 probability is called the Fermi energy.
The Fermi energy of a cathode changes with the SoC of the cell.

The redox potential of TEMPO is 0.812~V vs. SHE~\cite{Zhou2020}.
The absolute potential of the SHE is 4.44~V vs the vacuum level.
The workfunction of Au is 5.1 eV.
The electrochemical window of Acetonitrile is between -3.45~V and +2.35~V vs. SCE (+0.268 V vs SHE)~\cite{Luca2015}.

Electrochemical doping of a semicouducting polymer~\cite{Jacobs2022}:
Charge transfer, ion insertion.
The oxidation and reduction potentials of the ions are separated from the redox potentials of the polymer by several volts, so no charge transfer occurs between the polymer and the electrolyte. The positive charge injected to the polymer from the metal is compensated by the intercalated negative ion. The ionization efficiency in electrochemically doped films is close to 100\%~\cite{Jacobs2022}.\\
\par
During the charging of a poly-TEMPO-Salen half-cell, its electrochemically active cathode film is being oxidized: positive charges are being injected into it. If the bias potential of the cathode $E$ is higher than the oxidation potential of the polymer (see Figure~\ref{fig:band_diagram}~a)), a positive charge charge is injected to the pNiSalen backbone. The oxidation potential of pNiSalen was adjusted during the molecular synthesis to be close to the oxidation potential of TEMPO$^{\bullet}$, so that the oxidation of the backbone would lead to a simultaneous oxidation of the charge bearing groups~\cite{Vereshchagin2020}. If $E$ increases above the oxidation potential of TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ and the polymer backbone connecting the metal and the TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ fragment is oxidized, the injected hole reaches the TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ fragment and oxidizes it to TEMPO$^+$. The charge transfer process during the charging of the half-cell is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:band_diagram}~a). The oxidation TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ leads to a creation of an electric double layer next to the cathode~\cite{Bhojane2022} of A negative BF4${^-}$ ion is attracted from the electrolyte solution to the positively charged backbone.\\

The hole injected into the polymer backbone propagates in the direction of the Fermi energy gradient within the biased polymer until it encounters the unpaired electron on a TEMPO$^{\bullet}$ group and recombines with it. During the recombination, the hole disappears from the backbone and the electron disappears from the TEMPO$^{\bullet}$. The charge bearing group oxidizes to TEMPO$^+$. This process can be seen as the hole hopping from the backbone to the TEMPO radical. The TEMPO radicals therefore serve as hole traps.
