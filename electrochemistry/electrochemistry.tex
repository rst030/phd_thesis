\section{Rechargeable Electrochemical Cells}
Two opposite electric charges separated from each other can store energy in an electrostatic field. It is possible to accumulate many charges on the plates of a capacitor and store some energy~\cite{He_2022}, but due to the technological difficulties, electrochemical cells are commonly used instead~\cite{Figgener_2020}. An electrochemical cell is an energy storage device and a power source that undergoes a chemical reaction to transfer some electric charge from one of its components to another through an external circuit.

A simple electrochemical cell consists of three elements: two spatially separated materials called electrodes, and a solution of mobile ions between them called electrolyte. The two electrodes have different work functions, or, chemically speaking, reduction-oxidation (redox) potentials. The potential difference between the two electrodes is called the open-circuit potential of the cell, $V_{OC}$. When the electrodes are connected through an external circuit, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~a), the charge flows from one electrode to another through the circuit and the ions in the electrolyte rearrange to maintain charge balance~\cite{muench2016_chemrev}. While the cell delivers the electric current to the circuit, a chemical reaction is happening on its electrodes: the positively charged electrode, called cathode, is being reduced, obtaining electrons from the negatively charged anode through the external circuit. At the same time, the anode loses electrons and is being oxidized. If the electrodes can undergo a reversible redox reaction, a current applied to the cell restores its charged state, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~b).\\

The electrode of an organic electrochemical cell is made of a non-redox-active (metallic) lead and a layer of redox active (organic) molecules. The charge transfer between the conductor and the redox active molecule in the cathode can be described in terms of the energies of molecular orbitals of the cathode molecule~\cite{DOM,Wu_2023}. The oxidation potential of a molecule correlates with the energy of its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) ~\cite{Wu_2023}. When the electric potential $V$ of the biased metallic lead is set higher than the energy of the LUMO of the cathode molecule, an electron is transferred from the lead to the cathode molecule and the cathode molecule is reduced. The negative charge that emerges on the cathode is compensated by a positive ion of the electrolyte (cation). The reduction of the cathode results in a positive charge flow from the cathode through the external circuit to the opposite electrode of the cell, the anode. The charge flow implies that, upon adding an electron to the LUMO of the cathode molecule, an electron is removed from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the anode molecule and the anode molecule is oxidized. The positive charge that emerges on the anode is compensated by a negative ion of the electrolyte (anion). This redox reaction is the discharging of an electrochemical cell. The opposite reaction is charging. Upon charging, the cathode is oxidized and the anode is reduced.\\

It is possible to study the redox reaction at one electrode of the cell, e.g. the cathode, using a two-electrode half-cell setup. The studied electrode is called the working electrode (WE). The opposite electrode, called the reference electrode (RE), is made of a known material that maintains a constant composition and has a reproducible potential difference at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Any change in the potential difference between the WE and RE of the half-cell setup is therefore attributed to the processes in the WE only~\cite{Bard_book}.\\
However, when a half-cell is being charged and the current is flowing through the RE, a chemical reaction can take place at the RE, so its composition and the standard potential can be affected~\cite{Bard_book,DOM}. For this reason, a three-electrode half-cell shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~c) is used for characterizing battery electrodes that are designed for significant charging currents.\\

In the three-electrode half-cell, the charging current is applied between the WE and a chemically inert counter electrode (CE). The oxidation of the WE is accompanied by the formation of a double layer of the electrolyte molecules at the surface of the CE. The electric potential of the WE is measured as a potential difference between the WE and the calibrated RE, inserted in the electrolyte close to the CE. The potential difference between WE and RE is measured with a high impedance voltmeter that ensures no charge flow through the RE. That is, RE does not undergo a chemical reaction during the charging of WE, its chemical environment does not change during the experiment and the measured potential corresponds to the potential of the WE. Due to the finite dimensions of the electrodes and the finite thickness of the double layer around the CE, the RE cannot be inserted at the position of the CE, so the measured potential has a constant offset as the electrolyte between the points where WE, CE and CE are inserted, acts as a voltage divider~\cite{Bard_book}.\\

A general RE is the standard hydrogen electrode (Pt/H$_2$/H$^+$), or SHE. The main difference between the various RE is their operation range and a constant potential shift with respect to the SHE due to different equilibrium potentials. The couple Ag/AgNO$_3$ exhibits a shift of 0.7991~V vs. SHE and for the couple Ag/AgCl, the shift is 0.2223~V against SHE~\cite{Bard_book,DOM}, although these values can only be used if the configuration is strictly equivalent to the one used for determining them. In other cases, like in the case with a thin electrolyte layer in the modified sample tube, the exact shifts of the RE might differ~\cite{DOM}.\\

\subsection{Characteristics of Rechargeable Batteries}
Depending on the redox potentials of the used electrodes, the output voltage of an electrochemical cell ($V_{OC}$) ranges between 0 and 5~V~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater}. Most applications require higher voltages, so multiple cells are connected in series to form a battery. %For a commercial Li-polymer cell, the safe operating limits are $2.8$~V~$<V_{OC}<4.2$~V.\\

\paragraph{Capacity, C-rate and State Of Charge}
The capacity of a battery $C$ is measured in mAh. It is the maximal electric charge that can be stored in it. Different electrode materials can store different amounts of charge depending on their chemical structure and macroscopic structure. Due to the unavoidable losses of charge caused by the finite shunting resistance between the battery electrodes, one distinguishes between the charging capacity and the discharging capacity. The capacity of 1~g of an electro-active material is its gravimetric capacity, it is measured in mAhg$^{-1}$. The volumetric capacity is the corresponding value with respect to the volume of the material that is measured in mAhl$^{-1}$. The fraction of charge left in a cell with respect to the full charge that can be stored in that cell in percent is called the state of charge or SoC. The SoC of a fully charged battery is 100\%.\\
A battery is typically charged with a constant current. The magnitude of the charging (or discharging) current relative to the battery capacity determines the rate at which a battery is charged (or discharged). The charging rate, or C-rate is the charge or discharge current in Amps divided by the cell capacity in Ampere-hours. For a modern rechargeable Li-polymer battery a safe charging C-rate cannot exceed 1~C~\cite{Zhang2022}. That means, the charging time for a Li-polymer battery cannot be shorter than 1 hour. The discharge rate of the same battery, however, can be as high as 100~C that corresponds to a discharge current larger than the charging current by a factor of 100. The organic radical batteries can have charging and discharging C rates close to 3000~C and gravimetric discharge capacities upto 111~mAhg$^{-1}$~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,friebe2017_topcurrchem,Zens2022,Vereshchagin2022,Kulikov2023}.

\paragraph{State Of Health}
The capacity of a battery may decrease upon repeated charge-discharge cycling, especially at high C rates~\cite{Guan2018,Ouyang2020}, over-discharge~\cite{Ma2020} and extreme environmental conditions~\cite{Zhang2022}. The ratio of the maximum battery charge to its rated as-manufactured capacity expressed in percent is called the battery state of health (SoH). SoH is a measure of the remaining life time of a battery. The decrease in SoH indicates the intensified irreversible processes that take place in an electrochemical cell, such as a physical damage~\cite{Fu_2015}, degradation of the electrode material~\cite{Ma2020,Kulikov2022} or decomposition of the electrolyte~\cite{Fang_2021}. A damaged cell, especially that can store significant amount of charge, represents a major hazard~\cite{Ma2020}. Accurate measurements of SoH can prevent hazardous battery malfunctions such as explosions.

\section{Electrochemical Instrumentation}
\subsection{Cyclic Voltammogram}
The complete electrochemical behavior of a redox active molecular system can be obtained with a series of transient current responses to potentials, applied step-wise to the electrochemical cell containing the system. However for a basic electrochemical characterization a current response during a linearly swept potential is sufficient~\cite{Bard_book}. During the linear-potential-sweep chronoamperometry, or linear sweep voltammetry, the potential $E$ applied to the electrochemical cell is swept in a linear manner between the values $E_{min}$ and $E_{max}$, upwards and downwards, with a rate $v~($mVs$^{-1})$: $E(t) = E_0\pm vt$. During the sweep, the current is recorded as a function of the applied potential as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}~a). The resulting plot $i(E)$ is the cyclic voltammogram (CV). The upward potential sweep corresponds to the anodic, or charging branch of the CV and the downward sweep corresponds to the cathodic, or discharge branch. A CV of a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a pDiTBuS electro-active polymer film on the WE is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}~b). When $E$ reaches the oxidation potential of the working electrode, charge transfer happens and the current through the cell increases. This corresponds to the oxidation peak in the cathodic branch. The width of the peak is determined by the temperature of the cell and the number of electrons $n$ transferred in a single oxidation reaction ($n=2$ for poly-di-TEMPO-Salen, the redox conductive polymer discribed in Section~\ref{sec:ORB_materials}). The negative current peak in the anodic branch of the CV curve corresponds to the reduction of the WE. The difference between the potentials of the oxidation and reduction peaks arises because of the finite electric capacity of the electro-active film and a finite voltage sweep rate. For higher sweep rates the difference in peak potentials is higher, as the scan rate approaches the RC time constant of the cell.

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/CV_pDiTBuS.pdf}
	\caption{a): Electrochemical setup for CV. b): Linear voltage sweep at a 50~mVs$^{1}$ rate. c) Cyclic voltammogram of an electro-active polymer cathode film. Oxidation and reduction of the charge-bearing fragments of the film corresponds to the $A$ and $A^\prime$ redox peaks, respectively. Oxidation and reduction of the conductive polymer backbone of the film corresponds to peaks $B$ and $B^\prime$. The standard oxidation potential of the charge-bearing fragments, $E_{1/2}^A$, lies close to the standard oxidation potential of the backbone, $E_{1/2}^B$.}
	\label{fig:CV_DiTBuS}
\end{figure}

The area under the anodic branch can be used to calculate the charge that was transferred from the WE upon its reduction from the fully oxidized state. The voltage is swept at a known rate, so the anodic branch $i(E)$ can be plotted vs. time $i(t)$, hence the transferred charge equals to the integral under the curve: $q = \int_{E_{max}}^{E_{min}}i(t)dt$. By knowing the $q$ and considering the corresponding chemical reaction (how many electrons are transferred for one molecule) one gets the amount of substance in the electrode $\nu=qF$~[mol] and the number of electrochemically active molecules $N_{echem}=\nu N_A$ with $F=9.46853321233100184\times10^4$~C$\times$mol$^{-1}$ for the Faraday constant and $N_A=6.02214076\times10^{23}$~mol$^{-1}$ for the Avogadro constant~\cite{NIST}. Given the molecular weight $M$, the total mass of the electrochemically active molecules of the film can be calculated, and with the information on the density of the film its dimensions can be estimated. However as demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:quantitative_EPR} and in Refs.~\cite{Vereshchagin2022,Kulikov2022,Kulikov2023}, the number of electrochemically active molecules can be much lower than the total number of molecules in the film.  

\subsection{Charge-Discharge Cycling}
\label{sec:echem_charging}
\begin{figure}[h]

	\label{fig:GCD}
\end{figure}

A constant-current characterization technique called galvanostatic potentiometry~\cite{Bard_book} can be used in combination with the cyclic voltammetry to study the redox behavior of the electrochemical system quantitatively. To The setup for galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~a). The cell is excited with a DC current as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~b). Upon positive (charging) current the working electrode of the cell is oxidized. The voltage required to provide the charging current gradually increases, resulting a galvanostatic charging curve shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~b). The shape of the charging curve can be approximated by considering two major effects: the Faradic current and the displacement current. The Faradic current is caused by the oxidation of the redox active species in the WE. It defines the plateau regions in the middle of the charging and discharging curves. The displacement current is the result of the charging of a double layer around the WE and CE. It explains the capacitor-like response of the charging and discharging curves at their ends~\cite{Bard_book}. When all redox active species of the WE are oxidized, the voltage required for providing the charging current steeply increases, that is seen in the end of the charging curves in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c) and ~\ref{fig:GCD_DiTBuS}). Eventually, upon charging, the potential of the cell grows beyond the oxidation peak of the WE, according to the cyclic voltammogram (Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}). Then the charging is stopped and the transferred charge is calculated from the charging time. The same strategy is applied for the discharging curve to determine the discharging capacity of the cell. The reproducibility of the charge-discharge curve indicates the stability of the electrochemical cell. SoH of the cell can be estimated by observing the decrease in the period of the charge-discharge curve.

\section{Redox Conductive Polymers}

Redox active macromolecules or polymers~\cite{Staudinger_1920} are known since 1940s due to the works of Lauth and Cassidy~\cite{Cassidy_1949} on electron exchange polymers. After the discovery of the conductivity of polyacetylene by Shirakawa, Heeger and McDiarmid in 1977~\cite{Shirakawa_1977}, polymers with sufficient charge transport properties were synthesized~\cite{} and the field of organic electronics had emerged and expanded. 

\par

The key for polymer conductivity is the p $\pi$ - conjugated network, a system of overlapping $\pi$ orbitals of carbon in a chain of alternating single and double carbon-carbon bonds that allows charge delocalization along the polymer backbone. An example of a $\pi$ conjugated network is polyacetylene. Polyacetylene exhibits a band structure in the electron energy levels (between $\pi$ and $\pi^\star$ orbitals) and represents a molecular semiconductor.

\par

Organic solar cells~\cite{Lee_1993} and organic field effect transistors~\cite{Koezuka_1987} contain conjugated polymers that have electrical properties of semiconductors, yet can be easily printed in form of thin flexible films without using high temperatures. Combining the conductive polymers with stable radical side groups has formed the class of redox conductive polymers and lead to the concept of an organic radical battery~\cite{Rohland_2021}.

\subsection{Charge Transport Model for Redox Conductive Polymers}  
The transfer of charge between the metallic substrate of the electrode and the surface-bound molecules of the electrode can be described in terms of the electrode workfunction, applied potential, electrolyte dynamics and the LUMO level of the electrode molecule~\cite{Bard_book}. 
On the contrary, the transfer of charge between the molecules inside the volume of the electrode is a complex process that involves hopping and time-dependent delocalization of the charge carriers in the percolated network of the porous electrode material under a changing electrostatic field that is dependent on the state of charge of the electrode, as well as on the diffusion of the electrolyte ions. The molecular systems for electrochemical charge storage are inherently disordered materials and the electric performance of a film containing those molecules is strongly dependent on the deposition method, as well as on the molecular structure~\cite{Xie2021}. The particular charge transport models have been developed that are applicable to certain classes of polymers \ik{(look at that chapter in the polymer book + last talk at FU and show what was done)}, but so far there has not been a unified physical model that would describe the charge transport phenomena in redox-conductive polymer films.\\

The charge transfer within the redox-conductive polymer electrode governs the speed, reversibility, released by-products and physical conditions of the redox reaction in an organic electrochemical cell, that are the key factors that define the charging rate, cycling stability, self-discharge rate and the area of application of ORBs. This type of redox reaction had been of great interest for the field of energy storage, particularly, electrochemistry, where numerous characterization techniques have been developed to optimize the architecture of electrochemical power sources. In the following chapters a spectroelectrochemical analysis of organic redox-conductive polymers containing nitroxyl radicals is presented using the toolbox of the electron spin resonance spectroscopy.\\

\section{Organic Radical Battery}

Batteries based on conjugated polymers containing stable radical moieties as high-capacitance groups represent a promising class of future electrochemical power sources - organic radical batteries (ORB)~\cite{nakahara2002_cpl, nishide2004_electact,xie2021_mathoriz,Rohland_2021}. ORB combine the advantages of high-power supercapacitors, namely high discharge rates, and the high energy density of conventional lithium-ion technology. In contrast to the lithium-ion battery, the charging of an organic battery does not involve intercalation of metal ions into the electrodes. This reduces the structural change of the electrode upon repeated recharging which allows for a longer cycle life of an ORB. The semi-conducting nature of organic electrodes reduces the Joule heating during the battery operation, and this allows for higher charge/discharge rates. The amorphous and swollen structure of organic electrodes allows the electrolyte ions to diffuse faster into the electrode, which also increases the charge/discharge rate~\cite{nishide_2009}. A further beneficial property of organic materials over traditional inorganic materials is their availability and the low cost of the starting materials for the synthesis of the target polymers in conjunction with good mechanical properties~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater, muench2016_chemrev, friebe2017_topcurrchem}. The large knowledge base on polymer processing allows for inkjet printing, roll-to-roll processing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques for making low-cost, flexible and light-weight integrated devices, including flexible plastic batteries~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater,nishide_2009}. 

\section{Organic Electrode Materials}
\label{sec:ORB_materials}
ORB based on redox polymers containing stable radicals~\cite{nakahara2002_cpl} have been shown to compete with or even outperform  conventional Li based batteries in terms of power densities~\cite{IWASA2007} with the additional benefit of being free from rare precursors, inheriting mechanical properties of plastics and electrical properties of semiconductors~\cite{friebe2017_topcurrchem,Casado2021,Goujon2021}. Advanced molecular design techniques allow for tuning of the electrochemical properties of the redox polymers~\cite{Janoschka2017}, that brings in a rich variety of organic energy storage materials~\cite{Xie2021,Vereshchagin2022,Janoschka2017a} and creates a large room for their optimization. 

\par
\subsection{TEMPO}
TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:molecules}~a) is a small molecule and a stable radical that can undergo a fast and reversible redox reaction between TEMPO$^\bullet$ and TEMPO$^+$. TEMPO is an inexpensive organic compound~\cite{Vereshchagin2022} produced from acetone with liquid ammonia, hydrazine and peroxide~\cite{Casado_2021_book}. TEMPO radicals are widely used as spin labels studies of biological systems with electron spin resonance~\cite{Bordignon2017}, because the unpaired electron of TEMPO$^\bullet$ has a well defined spectral signature that changes when the local environment of a TEMPO fragment changes.

TEMPOL is a TEMPO with an OH group. It forms crystals.

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/materials/molecules.pdf}
	\caption{Chemical structures of the molecular fragments and polymers that were used for making a battery cathode containing stable nitroxide radicals.}
	\label{fig:molecules}
\end{figure}



Redox conductive conjugated polymers containing TEMPO redox groups, as pDiTBuS (poly-di-TEMPO-Butyl-Salen) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_1}, demonstrate particularly promising energy and power densities~\cite{Vereshchagin2020}. The pDiTBuS was designed as a cathode material: it is oxidized when the electrochemical cell containing this material is charged. A film of pDiTBuS comprises a high concentration of redox active stable nitroxyl radicals attached to a conjugated polymer backbone that interconnects them as a molecular wire. Such system can be viewed as a highly disordered molecular hole-transporting semiconductor (the poly-NiSalen backbone) that contains a large amount of hole traps (TEMPO groups) attached to it with butyl linkers. When the film is reduced (discharged), the TEMPO groups are in the radical state and act as unfilled traps. Upon oxidation (charging), the TEMPO fragments lose an unpaired electron and acquire a positive charge, so the traps are being filled with holes. The reversible redox reaction in the pDiTBuS film is demonstrated in a cyclic voltammogram shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}, c) and in the equal charging and discharging capacity of the film in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD_DiTBuS}, c).

\par
While active electrode materials with nitroxide radicals as redox-active groups are ideally suited for organic radical batteries (ORBs) that exhibit high power densities, the broad application of most nitroxide-based materials is limited by their moderate electrical properties. A promising route towards overcoming the conductivity problem is the use of polymers that combine radical-containing moieties and a conductive backbone. This strategy was successfully followed in a number of studies focusing on different polymers~\cite{oyaizu2015_polymerjournal, bahaceci2013_jpowersources, katsumata2006_mrc, xu2014_electact, aydin2015_jsoistatelect, schwartz2018_synthmet}. The standard redox potential of the NiSalen molecular backbone ($E_{1/2}^B$ in the middle of the peaks B and B$^\prime$ in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}) lay close to the standard redox potential of the attached nitroxide charge-bearing fragments ($E_{1/2}^A$ in the middle of the peaks A and A$^\prime$ in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}) - that ensures an efficient charge transport between the charge-bearing fragments and the conductive backbone and allows for very high charge and discharge rates up to 3000~C~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Kulikov2022}.

\subsection{PTMA}
A simple organic radical polymer containing TEMPO is poly-TEMPO-methacrylate) (PTMA, Figure~\ref{fig:molecules}~c). The polymer backbone of PTMA consists of single C-C bonds and therefore is not conductive, so the transport of charge in a PTMA film has to be mediated by adding conductive mesh such as activated carbon. When mixed with conductive carbon additive, PTMA has become a standard cathode material for ORBs and Li-ORBs, providing a discharge cell voltage of V$_{OC}=3.5$~V (with a Li anode) and a theoretical discharge capacity of $C_{theo}=111$~mAh/g~\cite{Daniel2023_Multimodal}. PTMA is soluble in acetonitrile (AN), chloroform (CF), tetrahydrofurane and dichlormethane. It is claimed to be insoluble in toluene, ethers, carbonates, and alcohols, however it becomes gel-like with some of these solvents~\cite{DOM}.

\subsection{NiSalen}
The molecular backbone of a redox conductive polymer has to conduct electric charge. A NiSalen molecule is a Schiff complex of Ni that has a conjugated path through it. The conductivity of NiSalen was measured. Upon oxidation of a polymeric NiSalen, the formation of positive polarons was observed in it with UV-Vis spectroscopy~\cite{Dmitrieva2018}, that suggests p-NiSalen is a p-type molecular semiconductor. p-NiSalen exhibits electrochemical capacity and can store up to two positive charges per monomer unit.


\subsection{Poly-Di-TEMPO-Salens}
Redox conductive conjugated polymers containing TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) redox groups, as pDiTS~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Kulikov2022} (poly-Di-Tempo-Salen) and pDiTBuS~\cite{Kulikov2023} (poly-di-TEMPO-Butyl-Salen) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:molecules} e) and f), demonstrate particularly promising energy and power densities with charging rates upto 3000~C and gravimetric capacity upto 91.5~mAh~g$^{-1}$ for pDiTS~\cite{Vereshchagin2020} and upto 75~mAh~g$^{-1}$ for pDiTBuS~\cite{Kulikov2023}. pDiTS and pDiTBuS have similar molecular structures, except for pDiTBuS has no oxygens in the linkers that connect the backbone to the TEMPO fragments, which has led to its higher electrochemical stability and a more efficient electro-polymerization, that allows for growing thicker films. pDiTS is a charge storage material that consists of TEMPO redox active molecular fragments~\cite{Vereshchagin2022,jeschke2012_annrevphyschem,Halbmair2016} interconnected by a redox conductive conjugated NiSalen backbone~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,Dmitrieva2018}. DiTS and DiTBuS monomers were synthesized in the Levin group at the Saint-Petersburg State University.\\
pDiTS was designed as a cathode material: it is oxidized when the electrochemical cell containing this material is charged. A film of pDiTBuS comprises a high concentration of redox active stable nitroxyl radicals attached to a conjugated polymer backbone that interconnects them as a molecular wire. Such system may be viewed as a highly disordered molecular hole-transporting semiconductor (the poly-NiSalen backbone) that contains a large amount of hole traps (TEMPO groups) attached to it with butyl linkers. When the film is reduced (discharged), the TEMPO groups are in the radical state and act as unfilled traps. Upon oxidation (charging), the TEMPO fragments lose an unpaired electron and acquire a positive charge, so the traps are being filled with holes~\cite{Kulikov2023}.

The process of polymerization is connecting multiple monomer units of one sort to a continuous molecular chain. Among various polymerization techniques, redox conductive molecules with pendant charge bearing groups the cyclic electropolymerization turned out to be an efficient technique. \\




Fast And Capacious:\\
"Electrochemical polymerization of DiTS was studied by means of the EQCM technique on piezoelectric crystals coated with platinum using a linear voltage sweep. The CV of DiTS (Figure FAC2A) shows the paired peaks A and A' at 0.55 V and 0.47 V respectively, which correspond to charging and discharging of the nitroxyl fragments. An irreversible anodic peak B corresponds to oxidative coupling of the NiSalen fragments
of DiTS, which results in the polymer p-DiTS~\cite{Vereshchagin_2019,Koshika_2009}. The gradual
increase of the CV current and the electrode mass (Figure FAC2A) in the subsequent cycles indicates the course of the polymerization process. An unusual feature in the EQCM curves, recorded during the electropolymerization process, is that the mass growth at the electrode occurs predominantly at potentials below the peak A' (Figure FAC2A), which is in contradiction to previous reports on the deposition of a NiSalen-type polymer, where polymerization occurs at potentials above the oxidation peak of the monomeric NiSalen.[22]
The CV sweep boundaries were varied to establish the optimal conditions for the polymerization of DiTS. Only the
redox peaks of the TEMPO moieties in solution are observed on CV (Figure 2C, curve i) while sweeping in 0.40–0.75 V range without polymer formation. An extension of the anodic
boundary to 0.90 V (Figure FAC2C, curve ii) led to an increase in EQCM mass and CV current, which indicates the polymer growth on the electrode surface. Further extension of the anodic region of the CV range (Figure 2C, curve iv) did not improve the polymerization process, but led to a decrease of
the conductivity of the film due to overoxidation (Figure FACS4), highlighting 0.90 V as an optimal position of the anodic boundary. While polymerization is possible at higher potentials on the surface of a clean substrate, low conductivity of the overoxidized film is blocking further monomer oxidation on the
surface, leading to rapid decrease in monomer oxidation current (Figure S4 and Figure 2C, curve iv). When the cathodic boundary was set near the A/A’ pair and the CV was performed
between 0.35 V and 0.90 V (Figure FAC2C, curve iii), no polymerization occurred, emphasizing the crucial role of the charge-discharge of the nitroxyl fragments in the polymerization process.\\

The conventional mechanism for the chain growth of polymeric NiSalens is based on the formation of radical cation
species. Although the NiSalen-centered radical cations of DiTS
are formed on the peak B (Figure FAC2A), apparently the polymerization proceeds at a low rate in this area of potentials, compared to other NiSalen type complexes~\cite{Novozhilova_2009}. Based on the
obtained results, we assume that the positive charge density both on the monomer molecules and deposited polymer layers grow rapidly above the A (Figure FAC2A) peak potential due to simultaneous oxidation of the NiSalen core and two TEMPO fragments in one molecule. High charge density causes intermolecular coulombic repulsion, acting as a coulombic "shield", which hinders the coupling of radical cation species and prevents the chain growth. As soon as the potential has decreased to the A' (Figure FAC2A) peak on the negative scan of the CV (Figure S5C, point C), rapid polymer growth occurred due to the discharge of the p-DiTS film, which deactivates the
coulombic shield. The formation of the polymer proceeds until the shield recovers during the next CV cycle due to the oxidation of nitroxyl fragments. At this point, a sharp decrease in mass occurs due to the desorption of the monomeric DiTS molecules repelled by the charging coulombic shield. The scheme of this process is depicted in Figure FAC2B and a scheme of the polymer formation process in Figure FAC2D.\\ 

The mass growth for one deposition cycle is ca. 0.3 ug cm 2 both for 5 mV s 1 and 50 mV s 1 CVs. Polymer deposition is observed both at potentials higher than 0.8 V and lower than 0.4 V, and during low rate CV almost two thirds of the overall polymer mass is formed at potentials more positive than the potentials of the
A/A' peaks. On the contrary, at 50 mV/s only one third of the polymer is formed at potentials higher than 0.8 V. This indicates that the Coulombic shielding from oxidized TEMPO groups allows coupling between the radical cations of DiTS and the charged TEMPO groups, though at quite low rate. The
possibility of polymerization at both potential regions was confirmed by the experiment consisting of a series of
successive iterations of potentiostatic and potentiodynamic syntheses, as well as open-circuit rest periods (See SI and Figure FACS6 for further discussion)"

\subsection{Ag/AgCl reference electrode}\label{Ref_electrode}
The Ag/AgCl reference (RE) electrode was formed by coating a layer of AgCl onto a 250~$\muup$m Ag wire galvanically from a 1~\textsc{m} aqueous solution of KCl. For that, the Ag wire and a Pt wire were connected as a cathode and an anode respectively to 10$\,$mL of the KCL solution and a DC potential of 500$\,$mV was applied for 7500$\,$s which resulted in a dark AgCl layer deposited onto the Ag cathode. In the beginning of the galvanic deposition, the current through the KCl solution was changing in a jumpy manner, that indicated the growth of the AgCl layer. The galvanic process was stopped after the current was stable for at least 300$\,$s.\\

\section{Ex Situ Electrochemistry}
\label{sample_fab_2}
The pDiTBuS film was brought to the desired oxidation state by galvanostatic discharging with a current of 10~$\muup$A in a three-electrode electrochemical cell in a 5~ml beaker with the electrodes and the electrolyte described above.
Each potential of the film was reached by first fully charging the cell to 700~mV and then discharging it to the desired potential (labeled points in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S3}). When the desired potential was \ik{reached}, the output relay of the potentiostat was opened so that no current went through the cell after charging. The substrate with the WE and the pDiTBuS film was removed from the charging cell, placed in a 5~mm OD quartz EPR tube, evacuated down to $<5\times10^{-3}$~mbar, filled with He up to a pressure of 500-600 mbar, then flame sealed with a H$_2$/O$_2$ burner.

After reaching the fully charged state with 10~$\muup$A (by $t=0$ in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}), a 10~$\muup$A discharge current was applied to reach the four states of charge considered in this study (a-d in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27} and in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S3}). Initially, the full charging capacity of the film was 1.48~$\muup$Ah~$=5.11$~\ik{m}C (3.29e+16 electrons withdrawn upon the full charging). The charging capacity has decreased by 0.06~$\muup$Ah ($4\%$) after the four temperature cycles between 300~K and 5~K during the cryogenic EPR measurements.\\

From the quantitative analysis of the GCD for each SoC, we calculate the number of elementary charges that are transferred to the film (withdrawn from the film) upon charging (discharging). The GCD and the calculated values of the transferred charge are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}. During the full discharge from +700~mV down to -200~mV the pDiTBuS film has gained a total charge of 1.355~$\muup$Ah=4.88~\ik{m}C (d), corresponding to 3.01e+16 electrons that had been transferred to the film.)

\ik{ 
The considered SoC correspond to discharging by $0.020\pm0.005~\muup$Ah (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}~a, $(5\pm1)\times10^{14}$ electrons injected), $0.060\pm0.005~\muup$Ah (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}~b, $(1.4\pm0.1)\times10^{15}$ electrons injected), $0.480\pm0.005~\muup$Ah (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}~c, $(1.07\pm0.01)\times10^{16}$ electrons injected) and $1.360\pm0.005~\muup$Ah (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}~d, $(3.05\pm0.01)\times10^{16}$~electrons injected). The SoC values determined from the respective potentials are different when mapped to the initial discharge curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_S3} and when considering the individual discharge curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure_S27}, as the film was gradually losing its capacity during the temperature cycling, so the discharge curves were reaching the considered potentials at shorter times, leading to a lower Coulomb counting, lower discharge capacity and therefore a lower SoC.}
