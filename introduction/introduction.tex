%Life needs energy to continue its spread. Plants use photosynthesis to separate carbon from oxygen and to grow. Higher life forms as humans consume energy during the day and during the night, being dependent on the available energy source~\cite{energy_consumption_review}. While fossil fuels are still the major source of energy~\cite{energy_sources_review} and while fire is used to convert the Joules that hold together hydrocarbon molecules into a "horse power" of a combustion engine and kilowatt-hours in a power socket, there are cleaner and more efficient ways to harvest energy. Photosynthesis had inspired the creation of solar panels that convert the sunlight into electricity, the atom had been tamed in the core of a nuclear reactor to power cities; we can extract energy from sound~\cite{energy_from_sound}, wind and waves and from the heat of the planet. Moreover, there are hopes and continuous attempts to achieve nuclear fusion~\cite{tokamak_updates} - the creation of an artificial Sun by melting together atomic cores - the virtually inexhaustible and clean source of energy. The oil and gas are limited and unevenly distributed resources, wind does not always blow, the Sun does not shine at night, the wild Nature is still unpredictable and the extracted energy has to be stored in order to level out its production and consumption.\\

\paragraph*{}
Energy storage systems such as fuel cells, supercapacitors and batteries are crucial elements for powering portable electronics and vehicles, or for balancing a power grid with a renewable energy source~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater}. Stable, capacious and powerful batteries have become of great demand for today's energy driven society~\cite{Yoo2014,Xu2020,Nitta2015}. The capacity of installed battery storage systems is predicted to increase upto 400~GWh by 2030~\cite{Figgener_2020}. The advances in lithium ion technology for rechargeable batteries have enabled energy densities that make it possible to battery-power a wearable Internet-of-things device~\cite{Lee2013,Maddikunta2020}, an airplane~\cite{Kadlec2014} or a house~\cite{Diouf2019,Hirasawa2021}. Still, the application of lithium ion batteries is limited by irreversible processes~\cite{Larsson2017,Fu2015,Zhang2021} that occur upon extreme operating conditions such as high power demand~\cite{Zhang2022,Guan2018} or over-discharge~\cite{Ma2020}. Such degradation processes limit the performance of a battery by lowering its safe operating power, resulting in lower power density and longer charging times. The challenge to overcome these limitations, together with low abundance of Lithium, Cobalt and rare earth metals,~\cite{Xu2020,janoschka2012_advmater}, the toxicity of the manufacturing process~\cite{Prazanov2022,Peters2017} and the biohazardous nature of the inorganic electrode materials~\cite{Casado_2021_book} is motivating research and development of advanced, organic-based battery technologies~\cite{Degen2022}. This requires understanding of charge transport and degradation pathways in energy storage materials as well as exploring novel materials such as materials based on organic precursors~\cite{Lu2020,Kim2023}.\\

\section{Rechargeable Electrochemical Cells}
Two opposite electric charges separated from each other can store energy in an electrostatic field. It is possible to accumulate many charges on the plates of a capacitor and store some energy~\cite{He_2022}, but due to the technological difficulties, electrochemical cells are commonly used instead~\cite{Figgener_2020}. An electrochemical cell is an energy storage device and a power source that undergoes a chemical reaction to transfer some electric charge from one of its components to another through an external circuit. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\label{fig:echem_cells}
\end{figure}

A simple electrochemical cell consists of three elements: two spatially separated materials called electrodes, and a solution of mobile ions between them called electrolyte. The two electrodes have different work functions, or, chemically speaking, reduction-oxidation (redox) potentials. The potential difference between the two electrodes is called the open-circuit potential of the cell, $V_{OC}$. When the electrodes are connected through an external circuit, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~a), the charge flows from one electrode to another through the circuit and the ions in the electrolyte rearrange to maintain charge balance~\cite{muench2016_chemrev}. While the cell delivers the electric current to the circuit, a chemical reaction is happening on its electrodes: the positively charged electrode, called cathode, is being reduced, obtaining electrons from the negatively charged anode through the external circuit. At the same time, the anode loses electrons and is being oxidized. If the electrodes can undergo a reversible redox reaction, a current applied to the cell restores its charged state, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~b).\\


\subsection{Organic Radical Battery}

Batteries based on redox conductive polymers containing stable radical fragments as high-capacitance groups represent a promising class of future electrochemical power sources - organic radical batteries (ORB)~\cite{nakahara2002_cpl, nishide2004_electact,xie2021_mathoriz,Rohland_2021}. ORB combine the advantages of high-power supercapacitors, namely high discharge rates, and the high energy density of conventional lithium-ion technology. In contrast to the lithium-ion battery, the charging of an organic battery does not involve intercalation of metal ions into the electrodes. This reduces the structural change of the electrode upon repeated recharging which allows for a longer cycle life of ORBs. The electrolyte ions in an ORB do not chemically react with the electrodes, but rearrange to compensate the charges in the electrode, that improves the safety and lifetime of ORBs as compared to the Li technology. The amorphous and swollen structure of organic electrodes allows the electrolyte ions to diffuse into the electrode, which allows for oxidizing or reducing the electrode within its volume - this also increases the charge/discharge rates of ORBs~\cite{nishide_2009}. A further beneficial property of organic materials over traditional inorganic materials is their availability and the low cost of the starting materials for the synthesis of the target polymers in conjunction with good mechanical properties~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater, muench2016_chemrev, friebe2017_topcurrchem}. The large knowledge base on polymer processing allows for inkjet printing, roll-to-roll processing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques for making low-cost, flexible and light-weight integrated devices, including flexible plastic batteries~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater,nishide_2009}. 


\section{Experimental Techniques for Characterizing Battery Materials}
The flexible molecular design together with questions regarding unresolved charge transport- and performance limiting mechanisms have inspired a variety of characterization techniques to be developed and applied to both energy storage materials and energy storage devices, operando (during the operation of a device) and ex-situ. Together with electrochemical characterization as the standard method for studying the properties of energy storage materials~\cite{Bard_book,IWASA2007,Zens2022}, operando optical microscopy~\cite{Merryweather2022}, neutron imaging~\cite{Ma2020}, mass spectroscopy~\cite{Fang_2021} and X-ray diffraction~\cite{Rhodes2012} were applied to monitor irreversible structural deformations of the components of Li cells during extreme charging conditions.\\

\par UV and IR spectroscopy turned out to be particularly useful for studying organic energy-storage materials. For instance, with UV-Vis spectroscopy, it was possible to observe formation of positive polarons in the conductive molecular backbone for ORBs upon its oxidation~\cite{Dmitrieva2018}.
Since the electrochemical processes happen within the bulk of the energy storage material and involve changes in the spin states, imaging techniques based on magnetic resonance can be applied to obtain structural information on the battery electrodes at the molecular level~\cite{Niemoller2018,Meier2013,Li2019,Bittl2005}. NMR was used to study dendrite formation, electrolyte dynamics and intercalation of Li ions\cite{Kushida1980,Grosu2023a} in Li cells, including operando imaging~\cite{Shi2019}.\\ 

Operando continuous-wave EPR (cwEPR) was applied to study redox-flow batteries~\cite{zhao2021_jacs}, redox kinetics of inorganic battery cathodes~\cite{Niemoller2019}, radical formation and spin densities in redox polymers~\cite{Dmitrieva2018} and in organic electrochemical cells~\cite{huang2016_jpowersources,Kulikov2022,kanzaki2018_acsappmat}.\\

Pulsed EPR (pEPR) provides an even more powerful toolbox for material studies with the electron spin as a microscopic structural probe. In particular, pEPR provides access to the dipolar coupling between neighboring electron spins and thus the possibility to determine distances between adjacent redox-active centers using dipolar spectroscopy~\cite{Salikhov1981} as in spin-labelled proteins~\cite{jeschke2012_annrevphyschem,Toropov1998}. In addition, the hyperfine coupling between electron and nuclear spins in close vicinity can be measured by the electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) and the electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques and can thus elucidate the degree of delocalization for charge carriers in ORB materials in a similar way as in organic seminconductors~\cite{Behrends2011}.

\section{Organic Electrochemical Cells}


\subsection{Cell Electrodes}
The electrode of an ORB is made of a non-redox-active (metallic) lead and a layer of redox active (organic) molecules attached to the metal through an atomic bond~\cite{Boiziau1988} that allows for electrical conductivity. The charge transfer between the conductor and the redox active molecule in the electrode can be described in terms of the molecular orbitals of the cathode molecule and the Fermi energy of the electrode~\cite{DOM,Wu_2023,Boiziau1988}. The oxidation potential of a molecule correlates with the energy of its highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) ~\cite{Sworakowski2018,Wu_2023}. A simple organic cathode consists of a metallic lead and one redox active molecule attached to it. When the electric potential $V$ of the metallic lead is set lower than the HOMO of the cathode molecule, and the other end of the molecule is "grounded" with the electrolyte to the anode, an electron can be transferred from the cathode molecule to the lead. The cathode molecule loses an electron and acquires a positive charge. Its electronic level lowers to HOMO-1. The positive charge in the molecule attracts a negative ion from the electrolyte. No charge transfer happens between the electrolyte ion and the charged molecule, but the movement of the ion allows the DC current to flow through the electrochemical cell, closing the electrical circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~a). In a cathode containing more than one layer of redox active molecules, together with the polymer-metal charge transfer, an intermolecular charge transfer has to take place in order to oxidize the next molecular layer.\\ 
A symmetric reaction on the anode is reducing the anode molecule and changing its state from HOMO to LUMO. These two redox reactions describe the charging of an electrochemical cell. The opposite reaction is discharging. Upon discharging, the cathode is oxidized and the anode is reduced. Excessive charging and discharging may lead to an irreversible chemical reaction in the electrodes and the reactions to the electrolyte, that is undesirable, so the potential of the cell has to be observed during its operation.\\


\subsection{Three-Electrode Cell}
It is possible to study the redox reaction only at one electrode of the cell, e.g. the cathode, using a chemically inert second electrode. A cell with only one redox active electrode is called a half-cell. The studied electrode is called the working electrode (WE). The opposite electrode, called the reference electrode (RE), is made of a known material that maintains a constant composition and has a reproducible potential difference at the electrode-electrolyte interface called the standard potential. Any change in the potential difference between the WE and RE of the half-cell setup is therefore attributed to the processes in the WE only~\cite{Bard_book}.\\
However, when a half-cell is being charged and the current is flowing through the RE, a chemical reaction can take place at the RE, changing its composition and the standard potential that change the parameters of the half-cell~\cite{Bard_book,DOM}. For this reason, a three-electrode half-cell shown in Figure~\ref{fig:echem_cells}~c) is used for characterizing battery electrodes that are designed for significant charging currents.\\

In the three-electrode half-cell, the charging current is applied between the WE and a chemically inert counter electrode (CE). The oxidation of the WE is accompanied by the formation of a double layer of the electrolyte molecules at the surface of the CE. The electric potential of the WE is measured as a potential difference between the WE and the calibrated RE, inserted in the electrolyte close to the CE. The potential difference between WE and RE is measured with a high impedance voltmeter that ensures minimal charge flow through the RE. That is, RE does not undergo a chemical reaction during the charging of WE, its chemical environment does not change during the experiment and the measured potential corresponds to the potential of the WE. Due to the finite dimensions of the electrodes and the finite thickness of the double layer around the CE, the RE cannot be inserted at the position of the CE, so the measured potential has a constant offset as the electrolyte between the points where WE, CE and CE are inserted, acts as a voltage divider~\cite{Bard_book}.\\


To measure the potential $E$ of the cell electrode, a calibrated, inert electrode is inserted to the cell and its potential is chosen as $E=0$. A general RE is the standard hydrogen electrode (Pt/H$_2$/H$^+$), or SHE. The main difference between the various RE is their operation range and a constant potential shift with respect to the SHE depending on the workfunction of the RE material. The couple Ag/AgNO$_3$ is commonly used in electrochemistry~\cite{Bard_book}. It exhibits a shift of 0.7991~V vs. SHE. For the couple Ag/AgCl, the shift is 0.2223~V against SHE~\cite{Bard_book,DOM}, although these values can only be used if the electrode configuration is strictly equivalent to the one used for determining them. In other cases, like in the case with a thin electrolyte layer in the modified sample tube, the exact shifts of the RE might differ~\cite{DOM}.\\

The Ag/AgCl reference (RE) electrode for the EPR-compatible electrochemical cells described in ~\ref{sec:tube_cell} was formed by coating a layer of AgCl onto a 250~$\muup$m Ag wire galvanically from a 1~\textsc{m} aqueous solution of KCl. For that, the Ag wire and a Pt wire were connected as a cathode and an anode respectively to 10$\,$mL of the KCL solution and a DC potential of 500$\,$mV was applied for 7500$\,$s which resulted in a dark AgCl layer deposited onto the Ag cathode. In the beginning of the galvanic deposition, the current through the KCl solution was changing in a jumpy manner, that indicated the growth of the AgCl layer. The galvanic process was stopped after the current was stable for at least 300$\,$s.\\

\subsection{Electrolyte}

Electrolyte is an ionic conductor~\cite{Bard_book} - an electrically conductive solution of oppositely charged ions that are typically products of dissociation of the corresponding salts. The dissociation of a salt in a solvent implies that the solvent has high enough dielectric constant $\varepsilon$ to polarize the salt molecule and to separate it into a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion) by creating solvation shells around them. High mobility of the electrolyte ions is needed for the efficient ion diffusion into the battery electrodes, so that the redox reaction can take place along the entire surface of the electrode material that is soaked into the electrolyte. The ionic mobility also influences the Ohmic losses and polarization of electric double layers, governing, together with the electronic properties of the electrodes, the power density of a battery~\cite{Neueder2014}.\\


\subsection{Characteristics of Rechargeable Batteries}
Depending on the redox potentials of the used electrodes, the output voltage of a cell ($V_{OC}$) ranges between 0 and 5~V~\cite{janoschka2012_advmater}. Most applications require higher voltages, so multiple cells are connected in series to form a battery.%For a commercial Li-polymer cell, the safe operating limits are $2.8$~V~$<V_{OC}<4.2$~V.\\

\paragraph{Energy and power density, C-rate and State Of Charge}
The capacity of a battery $C$ is measured in mAh. It is the maximal electric charge that can be stored in it. Different electrode materials can store different amounts of charge depending on their chemical structure and macroscopic structure. Due to the unavoidable losses of charge caused by the finite shunting resistance between the battery electrodes, one distinguishes between the charging capacity and the discharging capacity. The capacity of 1~g of an electro-active material is its gravimetric capacity, it is measured in mAhg$^{-1}$. The volumetric capacity is the corresponding value with respect to the volume of the material that is measured in mAhl$^{-1}$. The energy stored in a battery is a product of its capacity and its voltage. The ratio of the stored energy to the volume of the battery is its energy density. The energy density of a battery depends on the capacity of the electrodes and the potential difference between the electrodes~\cite{Liu2016}. The fraction of charge left in a cell with respect to the full charge that can be stored in that cell in percent is called the state of charge or SoC. The SoC of a fully charged battery is 100\%.\\
\par
A battery is typically charged with a constant DC current. The magnitude of the charging (or discharging) current relative to the battery capacity determines the rate at which a battery is charged (or discharged). The charging rate, or C-rate is the charge or discharge current in Amps divided by the cell capacity in Ampere-hours. For a modern rechargeable Li-polymer battery a safe charging C-rate cannot exceed 1~C~\cite{Zhang2022}. That means, the charging time for a Li-polymer battery cannot be shorter than 1 hour. The discharge rate of the same battery, however, can be as high as 100~C that corresponds to a discharge current larger than the charging current by a factor of 100. The power that a battery can deliver depends on its maximal C rate and equals to the product of its short-circuit current and its voltage. The organic radical batteries can have charging and discharging C rates close to 3000~C and gravimetric discharge capacities upto 111~mAhg$^{-1}$~\cite{Vereshchagin2020,friebe2017_topcurrchem,Zens2022,Vereshchagin2022,Kulikov2023,Tarascon2001}. While the capacities of the organic electrode materials are smaller than for the Li metal electrodes (3850 mAh$g^{-1}$), the organic electrode materials allow for much higher C rates that already exceed the C rate of the conventional inorganic cells by orders of magnitude~\cite{Diouf2019}.

\paragraph{State Of Health}
The capacity of a battery may decrease upon repeated charge-discharge cycling, especially at high C rates~\cite{Guan2018,Ouyang2020}, over-discharge~\cite{Ma2020} and extreme environmental conditions~\cite{Zhang2022}. The ratio of the maximum battery charge to its rated as-manufactured capacity expressed in percent is called the battery state of health (SoH). SoH is a measure of the remaining life time of a battery. The decrease in SoH indicates the intensified irreversible processes that take place in an electrochemical cell, such as a physical damage~\cite{Fu_2015}, degradation of the electrode material~\cite{Ma2020,Kulikov2022}, side reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface~\cite{Tarascon2001}, or decomposition of the electrolyte~\cite{Fang_2021}. A damaged cell, especially that can store significant amount of charge, represents a major hazard~\cite{Ma2020}. Accurate measurements of SoH can prevent hazardous battery malfunctions such as explosions.

\section{Electrochemical Instrumentation}
\subsection{Cyclic Voltammogram}
The complete electrochemical behavior of a redox active molecular system can be obtained with a series of transient current responses to potentials, applied step-wise to the electrochemical cell containing the system. However for a basic electrochemical characterization a current response during a linearly swept potential is sufficient~\cite{Bard_book}. During the linear-potential-sweep chronoamperometry, or linear sweep voltammetry, the potential $E$ applied to the electrochemical cell is swept in a linear manner between the values $E_{min}$ and $E_{max}$, upwards and downwards, with a rate $v~($mVs$^{-1})$: $E(t) = E_0\pm vt$. During the sweep, the current is recorded as a function of the applied potential as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}~a). The resulting plot $i(E)$ is the cyclic voltammogram (CV). The upward potential sweep corresponds to the anodic, or charging branch of the CV and the downward sweep corresponds to the cathodic, or discharge branch. A CV of a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a pDiTBuS electro-active polymer film on the WE is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}~b). When $E$ reaches the oxidation potential of the working electrode, charge transfer happens and the current through the cell increases. This corresponds to the oxidation peak in the cathodic branch. The width of the peak is determined by the temperature of the cell and the number of electrons $n$ transferred in a single oxidation reaction ($n=2$ for poly-di-TEMPO-Salen, the redox conductive polymer discribed in Section~\ref{sec:ORB_materials}). The negative current peak in the anodic branch of the CV curve corresponds to the reduction of the WE. The difference between the potentials of the oxidation and reduction peaks arises because of the finite electric capacity of the electro-active film and a finite voltage sweep rate. For higher sweep rates the difference in peak potentials is higher, as the scan rate approaches the RC time constant of the cell.

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/CV_pDiTBuS.pdf}
	\caption{a): Electrochemical setup for measuring a cyclic voltammogram. b): Linear voltage sweep at a 50~mVs$^{1}$ rate. c) Cyclic voltammogram of an electro-active polymer cathode film. Oxidation and reduction of the charge-bearing fragments of the film corresponds to the $A$ and $A^\prime$ redox peaks, respectively. Oxidation and reduction of the conductive polymer backbone of the film corresponds to peaks $B$ and $B^\prime$. The standard oxidation potential of the charge-bearing fragments, $E_{1/2}^A$, lies close to the standard oxidation potential of the backbone, $E_{1/2}^B$.}
	\label{fig:CV_DiTBuS}
\end{figure}

The area under the anodic branch can be used to calculate the charge that was transferred from the WE upon its reduction from the fully oxidized state. The applied voltage is swept at a known rate, so the anodic branch $i(E)$ can be plotted vs. time $i(t)$, hence the transferred charge equals to the integral under the curve: $q = \int_{E_{max}}^{E_{min}}i(t)dt$. By knowing the $q$ and considering the corresponding chemical reaction (how many electrons are transferred for one molecule) one gets the amount of substance in the electrode $\nu=qF$~[mol] and the number of electrochemically active molecules $N_{echem}=\nu N_A$ with $F=9.46853321233100184\times10^4$~C$\times$mol$^{-1}$ for the Faraday constant and $N_A=6.02214076\times10^{23}$~mol$^{-1}$ for the Avogadro constant~\cite{NIST}. Given the molecular weight $M$, the total mass of the electrochemically active molecules of the film can be calculated, and with the information on the density of the film its dimensions can be estimated. However as demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:quantitative_EPR} and in Refs.~\cite{Vereshchagin2022,Kulikov2022,Kulikov2023}, the number of electrochemically active molecules in a polymer cathode film can be much lower than the total number of molecules in it.  

\subsection{Charge-Discharge Cycling}
\label{sec:echem_charging}
\begin{figure}[h]

	\label{fig:GCD}
\end{figure}

A constant-current characterization technique called galvanostatic potentiometry~\cite{Bard_book} can be used in combination with the cyclic voltammetry to study the redox behavior of the electrochemical system quantitatively. The setup for galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~a). The cell is excited with a DC current as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~b) and the potential of the cell is measured as a function of time, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c). Upon positive (charging) current, the working electrode of the cell is oxidized. The voltage required to provide the charging current gradually increases, resulting a galvanostatic charging curve shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c). The shape of the charging curve can be approximated by considering two major effects: the Faradic current and the displacement current~\cite{Bard_book}. The Faradic current is caused by the oxidation of the redox active species in the WE. It defines the plateau regions in the middle of the charging and discharging curves. The displacement current is the result of the charging of a double layer around the WE and CE. It explains the capacitor-like response of the charging and discharging curves at their ends~\cite{Bard_book}. In this regard the electrochemical cell with only one redox active can be treated as a pseudocapacitor~\cite{He_2022,Vereshchagin2022}. When all redox active species of the WE are oxidized, the voltage required for providing the charging current steeply increases, that is seen in the end of the charging curves in Figure~\ref{fig:GCD}~c) and ~\ref{fig:GCD_DiTBuS}. Eventually, upon charging, the potential of the cell grows beyond the oxidation peak of the WE, according to the cyclic voltammogram (Figure~\ref{fig:CV_DiTBuS}). Then the charging is stopped and the transferred charge is calculated from the charging time. The same strategy is applied for the discharging curve to determine the discharging capacity of the cell. The reproducibility of the charge-discharge curve indicates the stability of the electrochemical cell. SoH of the cell can be estimated by observing the decrease in the period of the charge-discharge curve.

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./electrochemistry/figures/GCD_pDiTBuS.pdf}
	\caption{Galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling of a pDiTBuS electro-active film with a discharge capacity $C_{DCG}=1.6\pm0.1~\muup$Ah recorded with 10~$\muup$A charging and discharging current that corresponds to charging and discharging at a C rate of $6.3\pm0.4$~C.}
	\label{fig:GCD_DiTBuS}
\end{figure}

A cell can also be charged by applying a constant voltage to it and by letting the applied current to change upon charging, this mode is called potentiostatic chronoamperometry. A positive voltage applied to a discharged cell will initially result in a large current. Upon potentiostatic charging, the charging current decreases with time, as the cell voltage approaches the applied voltage.

\section{Redox Conductive Polymers}

Redox active macromolecules or polymers~\cite{Staudinger_1920} are known since 1940s due to the works of Lauth and Cassidy~\cite{Cassidy_1949} on electron exchange polymers. After the discovery of the conductivity of polyacetylene by Shirakawa, Heeger and McDiarmid in 1977~\cite{Shirakawa_1977}, organic semiconducting polymers with sufficient charge carrier mobilities ($\muup>1~$cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) were synthesized~\cite{Hu2021}, and the field of organic electronics had emerged~\cite{heeger_polymers,Casado_2021_book}. Electron and hole mobilities in modern organic semiconductors have reached the values as high as $\muup>10~$cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$~\cite{Hu2021} and, theoretically, can be above $\muup>100~$cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ for organic molecular co-crystals~\cite{Zhu2012}, which enables efficient charge transport in fast-switching organic electronic circuits. Organic solar cells~\cite{Lee_1993}, organic field effect transistors~\cite{Koezuka_1987,Yan2009}, e-papers~\cite{Hu2021} and organic electrochemical neurons~\cite{Harikesh2022} contain conjugated polymers that have electrical properties of semiconductors, yet can be easily printed in form of thin flexible films without using high temperatures, can be bio-integrated and undergo an environmentally friendly recycling~\cite{nishide_2009}. A combination of conductive polymers with charge-bearing organic radicals~\cite{IWASA2007} has formed the class of redox conductive polymers~\cite{Casado_2021_book} and lead to the concept of an organic radical battery~\cite{Rohland_2021,nishide2004_electact,nakahara2002_cpl,Xie2021} - the last missing component needed for making an electronic device fully organic.\\

\subsection{Semiconducting Polymers}
\par
The key for polymer conductivity is the $\pi$ - conjugated network, a system of overlapping $\pi$ orbitals of carbon in a chain of alternating single and double carbon-carbon bonds that allows charge delocalization along the polymer backbone~\cite{heeger_polymers,Koehler_book,Casado_2021_book}. An example of a $\pi$ conjugated network is polyacetylene shown in Figure~\ref{fig:homo-lumo}. Polyacetylene exhibits a band structure in the electron energy levels (between $\pi$ and $\pi^\star$ orbitals) and represents a molecular semiconductor.\\
\par
A simple organic molecule, ethylene, shown in Figure \ref{fig:ethylene}, contains two carbon atoms and four hydrogens. Each carbon atom has six electrons. The four unpaired electrons of carbon - one at the $2s$ orbital and three at the $2p$ orbital - interact to form two $sp^2$- hybridized orbitals and one unhybridized $p_z$ orbital, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pi-bond}. 

\begin{figure} [h]

	  \label{fig:conjugation}
\end{figure}

The hybridized $sp^2$ orbitals form $\sigma$ bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. The $\sigma$ bonds keep the carbon atoms together in the molecule. The remaining $p_z$ orbitals interact with each other and form a $\pi$ bond so that $p_z$ electrons are shared between the carbon atoms. The interaction between $p_z$ orbitals results in two molecular orbitals, the bonding ($\pi$) and the antibonding ($\pi^*$) orbitals~\cite{Dermtroeder_3}. A $\pi$ orbital is described by a symmetric wavefunction and $\pi^*$ orbital is described by an antisymmetric wavefunction. A $\pi$ orbital has a lower energy than $\pi^*$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:homo-lumo}. The symmetric $\pi$ orbital is more energetically favorable, so the electrons occupy it at the equilibrium. Because of that, the $\pi$ orbital is called the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and $\pi^*$ is the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO). There is a forbidden energy zone between HOMO and LUMO which is equivalent to a bandgap of a semiconductor.\\ 
\par
In a longer molecule, the $\pi$/$\pi^*$ states are delocalized over many carbon atoms. This is known as conjugation and the number of conjugated atoms determine the conjugation length. As conjugation length increases, the HOMO and LUMO levels for each pair of carbon atoms in the molecule become slightly different. In a polymer with a very large conjugation length, many energy levels around HOMO and LUMO overlap which forms energy bands, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:conjugation}~\cite{Koehler_book,cambridge}. At a finite temperature, there is a non-zero population of electrons above the LUMO level which allows them to move freely along the chain of overlapping $p_z$ orbitals and makes conjugated polymers conductive~\cite{heeger_polymers}.\\

\par Even though conjugated polymers have band-like energy structure and a bandgap, their charge-transport properties are different from crystalline semiconductors. Real polymer chains have finite lengths that brings disorder to an organic semiconductor (Figure \ref{fig:hopping}~a). The disorder causes localization of electronic wave functions, that is known as charge carrier trapping, and hinders the electrical transport in semiconductors~\cite{Yi2016,Meier2013}, so when an external electric field is applied, a charge needs additional energy to hop from one localized state to another for electric current to flow (Figure \ref{fig:hopping}~b). In Figure \ref{fig:hopping}~c) it is shown how a charge moves through a disordered organic semiconductor choosing the optimal path in both energy and space domains. This mode of charge transport is referred to as the hopping transport~\cite{Tessler2009}.\\

Redox conductive polymers (RCP), besides being conductive, are able to store a charge. Typically, a RCP has a large concentration of charge bearing fragments that are interconnected by the polymer backbone~\cite{Casado_2021_book}. Storage of charge implies that the stored charge carriers are localized and cannot freely move within the polymer, unless the appropriate electric field is applied to release them to the conjugated network. In this regard, the charge bearing fragments of an RCP can be viewed as charge carrier traps. The high concentration of the charge carrier traps in a conductive polymer makes neither the hopping-charge transport model~\cite{Sato2018}, nor the band-like transport model~\cite{Koehler_book} applicable to describe the electric transport in these materials, so alternative models were developed.

\subsection{Charge Transport in a Polymer Electrode}  

\par
The charge transfer within a RCP electrode governs the speed, reversibility, physical conditions and release of by-products of the redox reaction in an organic electrochemical cell, that are the key factors that define the charging rate, cycling stability, self-discharge rate and the area of application of the cell.\\

\par
The transfer of charge between the metallic substrate of the electrode and the surface-bound molecules of the electrode can be described in terms of the electrode workfunction, the LUMO level of the electrode molecule and the applied potential~\cite{Bard_book}. 
On the contrary, the transfer of charge between the molecules within the volume of the electrode is a complex process that involves hopping and time-dependent delocalization of the charge carriers in the percolated network of the porous electrode material. Furthermore, the number of available charge bearing groups and the resulting local electric fields in the electrode are changing depending on the state of charge of the electrode, that implies that the conductivity of the RCP strongly depends on its state of charge~\cite{Zhang2018}.
The microscopic structure of the electrode affects the diffusion of the electrolyte ions, that also affects the charge transport properties of the electrode~\cite{Koshika_2009,He_2022}.\\ 

\par
Molecular systems for electrochemical charge storage are inherently disordered materials and the electric performance of a film containing those molecules is strongly dependent on the deposition method, as well as on the molecular structure~\cite{Xie2021,Zhang2018}. Some charge transport models have been developed, that are applicable to certain classes of polymers. The charge transfer between the radicals in non-conductive redox polymers is described with the diffusion cooperation model that involves charge hopping between the charge bearing fragments as well as their Brownian motion~\cite{Sato2018}. Mixing the non-conductive redox polymers with conductive additives such as activated carbon~\cite{Vereshchagin2022,Daniel2023_Multimodal} allows for efficient transport of charges through the conductive additive. The carbon mesh makes it possible to oxidize most of the redox active groups in the electrode and allows for the electrolyte to diffuse into the electrode, but also adds a significant amount of ``dead mass'' that decreases the specific capacity of such electrodes. In RCPs, the conductive  mesh is created by the polymer backbone - that reduces the dead mass and allows for higher specific capacities. The transport of charge in such materials includes direct hopping between the charge bearing groups, transfer of charge between the charge-bearing group and the conductive polymer backbone; transport of charge through the backbone, and the transport of electrolyte ions inside the polymer mesh. Those many factors affecting the performance of an RCP with a certain molecular structure lead to unexpected results, such as the decrease of the electrode conductivity with the increase of the number of charge-bearing radicals per monomer unit in a Poly~(3-hexylthiophene)/TEMPO RCP~\cite{Zhang2018}.
